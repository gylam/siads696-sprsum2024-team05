Social, economic and cultural practices create, enforce and perpetuate legalized gender inequalities and discrimination in all aspects of women's lives. Neither country has met its obligations under international human rights law. As a result, women continue to be disproportionately vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. This is most starkly demonstrated by the association of gender discriminatory beliefs and sexual risk-taking documented in this report. In Botswana, participants who held three or more gender discriminatory beliefs had 2.7 times the odds of having unprotected sex in the past year with a non-primary partner as those who held fewer beliefs. In Swaziland, those surveyed who held 6 or more discriminatory attitudes had twice the odds of having multiple sexual partners than those who held less than 6.  In both Botswana and Swaziland, a substantial percentage of PHR community survey participants who had been tested for HIV reported that they could not refuse the test. The continuing extraordinary prevalence of HIV in Botswana, particularly among women, demonstrates that campaigns, scaled-up HIV testing, including routine testing, and anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment are not enough. Women must be empowered with legal rights, sufficient food and economic opportunities to gain agency of their own lives. Men must be educated and supported to acknowledge women's equal status and throw off the yoke of socially- and culturally-sanctioned discriminatory beliefs and risky sexual behavior. HIV/AIDS interventions focused solely on individual behavior will not address the factors creating vulnerability to HIV for women and men in Botswana and Swaziland, nor protect the rights and assure the wellbeing of those living with HIV/AIDS. National leaders, with the assistance of foreign donors and others, are obligated under international law to take immediate steps to change the unequal social, legal and economic conditions of women's lives which facilitate HIV transmission and impede testing, care and treatment. Without these immediate and comprehensive reforms, they cannot hope to halt the deadly toll of HIV/AIDS on their populations.","Epidemic of Inequality: Women's Rights and HIV/AIDS in Botswana & Swaziland Introduction  Deeply entrenched gender inequities perpetuate the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Botswana and Swaziland, the two countries with the highest HIV prevalence in the world.10 The legal systems in both countries grant women lesser status than men, restricting property, inheritance and other rights.

In most cases improvements were driven solely by the clusters in the field, with little or no support from the global clusters, which had not yet completed or implemented the bulk of their capacity projects, due in part to late receipt of funding.

CMAO is modeled on similar UN-established indigenous mine clearance operations in Mozambique, Afghanistan and Cambodia. Under the terms of the Lusaka Protocol, the warring parties (UNITA/FAA) are responsible for mine clearance. UNAVEM III is mandated to stay in Angola until Feb. 97.  Accomplishments SITUATION - United Nations mine clearance operations in Angola are set to begin in early Mar. 96. Internal UN budgeting and deployment delays, combined political instability, and a shaky cease-fire on the ground, led to lengthy delays. The UNAVEM III operation is budgeted for 1,080 deminers. NGOs have established programmes working under contract to donors.  Mine Awareness: The INAROE Mine Awareness Programme has graduated 59 students, bringing the aggregate total to 106 graduates.  Mine Clearance: Should start early Mar. 96.  Mine Training: Set to start 22 Jan. 96.  Mine Survey: See NPA data. Deployment and Roads: The Mechem contract has been officially approved by the Angolan government and was due to start in Dec. 95.  GOALS FOR 1995 - Priority actions for CMAO during 1995 included:  1) Create the Instituto Nacional de Accao sobre as Minas - INAM (National Mine Action Institute) so the Government of Angola can ultimately assume responsibility for mine clearance.  2) Mine experts will be hired to supervise Government and UNITA engineers in verifying, surveying and, where essential, clearing mines.  3) Expand mine awareness education to cover all repatriation camps and internally displace populations, UN and NGO personnel, and affected Angolan communities.  4) Survey all provinces for mines and establish a national land mine database for urban areas in mine-infested cities.  5) Establish the Central Mine Action Training School in Luanda. Smaller schools, already established in Kuito, Luena, and Malange, will be afffiliated with the Luanda school to ensure standard operating procedures.  6) Verify and clear mines. Establish priorities for verification and clearance using a special priority rating system for exceptional clearance requests.  7) Establish regional mine action offices in each of the six UNAVEM headquarters. These offices will coordinate all UN and NGO mine action projects.  Organisations involved in the programme Halo Trust Mines Advisory Group (MAG) Norwegian People's Aid (NPA) Halo Trust Purpose: (Dec. 95) Halo is demining within the city of Kuito  Mines Advisory Group (MAG) Purpose: (Jan. 96) In 1992 MAG worked with UNHCR to establish a mine awareness poster campaign. In 1993 MAG assesssed the impact of mines on civilians and humanitarian aid assistance, and in early 1994 set up base in Luena, Moxico province. MAG reports that it chose Luena province because of the town's severe mine problem, which includes defensive mined rings that have been remined over the years.  Accomplishments: (Jan. 96) Demining: Since the first demining team became operational a total of 85,610 msq has been cleared of 5 mines and 93 UXO. Average monthly clearance is 24,000 msq. The Luena minefields are relatively low density and overgrown with vegetation.  Mine Awareness: A community mine awareness programme (CMAP) is in place  Norwegian People's Aid (NPA) Purpose: (Dec. 95) NPA arrived in-country in Sep. 94. NPA will survey the northern 11-12 provinces. There are four teams consisting of two survey officers and one interpreter. NPA is also involved in a mine awareness campaign to train 420 unemployed Angolans as instructors to teach IDPs about the mines threat before they return home. Accomplishments: (Dec. 95) NPA has begun training two demining platoons of 50 deminers in Malanje. They will open the 400 km Luanda-Malanje corridor.  Funding and cost: The Norwegian Govt. will pay 75% of the NPA survey cost of US$2 million. The Malanje demining will be partly covered by a Norwegian Govt. grant of US$600,000. The UN and Norway will each pay US$2 million to fund the National Demining School.","DHA Demining Programme Report Angola Country Report Structure SITUATION - Under the Unit for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Angola (UCAH), the Central Mine Action Office (CMAO), in cooperation with the United Nations Verification Mission to Angola (UNAVEM III), is developing a comprehensive mine action plan, established with funds raised through a Consolidated Appeal.

Establish priorities for verification and clearance using a special priority rating system for exceptional clearance requests.  7) Establish regional mine action offices in each of the six UNAVEM headquarters. These offices will coordinate all UN and NGO mine action projects.  Organisations involved in the programme Halo Trust Mines Advisory Group (MAG) Norwegian People's Aid (NPA) Halo Trust Purpose: (Dec. 95) Halo is demining within the city of Kuito  Mines Advisory Group (MAG) Purpose: (Jan. 96) In 1992 MAG worked with UNHCR to establish a mine awareness poster campaign. In 1993 MAG assesssed the impact of mines on civilians and humanitarian aid assistance, and in early 1994 set up base in Luena, Moxico province. MAG reports that it chose Luena province because of the town's severe mine problem, which includes defensive mined rings that have been remined over the years.  Accomplishments: (Jan. 96) Demining: Since the first demining team became operational a total of 85,610 msq has been cleared of 5 mines and 93 UXO. Average monthly clearance is 24,000 msq. The Luena minefields are relatively low density and overgrown with vegetation.  Mine Awareness: A community mine awareness programme (CMAP) is in place  Norwegian People's Aid (NPA) Purpose: (Dec. 95) NPA arrived in-country in Sep. 94. NPA will survey the northern 11-12 provinces. There are four teams consisting of two survey officers and one interpreter. NPA is also involved in a mine awareness campaign to train 420 unemployed Angolans as instructors to teach IDPs about the mines threat before they return home. Accomplishments: (Dec. 95) NPA has begun training two demining platoons of 50 deminers in Malanje. They will open the 400 km Luanda-Malanje corridor.  Funding and cost: The Norwegian Govt. will pay 75% of the NPA survey cost of US$2 million. The Malanje demining will be partly covered by a Norwegian Govt. grant of US$600,000. The UN and Norway will each pay US$2 million to fund the National Demining School.",https://reliefweb.int/node/25716,-12.1,17.91,ago,Angola,1996-05-09T00:00:00+00:00,1468,UN DHA Mine Clearance and Policy Unit,Situation Report,688.0

(Source: UN/DPKO)  12 Dec. 95 - Responding to criticism that the UN peacekeeping operation in Angola was stalled, the Secretary-General remarked: ""Many of the factors that prevented implementation of the earlier peace accords are still very much in evidence - distrust, continuing military activities, foot-dragging over quartering and related activities, obstruction of free movement and the restoration of government administration, lack of respect for the UN and other international personnel."" The UN has been unable to start its preliminary mine clearance operations, which must proceed before its forces can be fully deployed.  OVERVIEW SITUATION  9 Feb 96 - Despite a 15-month cease-fire and several UN arms embargoes, Angola's government and UNITA rebels continue to receive weapons that fuel a continuing low-level war, Human Rights Watch says in a new report. These new weapon shipments are seen as undermining the demobilization and demilitarization efforts which as the core of the peace process.  Human Rights Watch indicates that finding weapons backer is difficult since ""some of the shipments to UNITA have gone through surreptitious routes"". This has been exacerbated by the maintenance of mercenaries by both sides. One South African-based frim . Executive Outcomes (EO) has been employed by both sides to provide security and training. Although Angolan President Dos Santos has stated that EO's contract has been cancelled and all its personnel are out of the country, Human Rights Watch argues that the firm might be using several front companies to carry out contracts. The new report names Saracen International, Stuart Mills International and Shibata Security as suspected EO front companies helping in mine clearance. (Source: First!)  8 Feb 96 - The Security Council, by resolution 1045, renewed UNAVEM III's mandate for three months. The resolution expressed deep concern at ""the numerous delays in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol"".

The UN states that joint demining, opening of raods and the free circulation of people throughout the country is imperative for national reconciliation. (Source: DPKO)  6 Feb 96 - Brian Atwood, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has sent a letter to UNITA leader Savimbi suggesting that both UNITA and the government begin to eliminate their stockpiles of landmines. (Source: HEWS)  Dec 95 - ""The whole of Angola must be considered a mined area."" That comment, made by a South African brigadier, sums up the dismal land mine situation in Angola. For three decades land mines have been used to devastating effect by a wide array of groups. ""The scope and complexity of the mine threat is probably greater than in any other country and will require a well-coordinated approach,"" notes the Executive Summary of the UN Mine Action Programme for Angola.  Roads, waterways, railroads, airports, ports, towns and private dwellings were mined in a scorched earth conflict that meant to deny the enemy land and resources that could not be held by army personnel. Bridges were mined to prevent saboteurs from attacking them; they were mined again after destruction to prevent repair work. Soldiers in retreat on both sides during the 1992 strife are reported to have mined schools, hospitals and markets.  Food supplies have been seriously affected by mines. People trapped in beseiged cities were forced to venture into mine infested areas to get to food. The 200,000 strong town of Luena, ringed by defensive minefields, is almost completely dependent on WFP food aid because the minefields have reduced the amount of land available for sustainable agriculture.  Repatriation of some 250,000 refugees from abroad, and resettlement of one million displaced persons inside Angola, is an essential part of the peace process. But the 9-15 million land mines threaten to derail peaceful repatriation and will ensure that Angola remains an economic basketcase for years to come. The mine menace poses an immediate threat to the in-coming UNAVEM III peace-keepers, mandated to hold the peace and begin a massive national reconstruction effort. The re-establishment of regional governments, and plans to hold elections may be dependent on mine clearance.  Casualties The UN estimates that 1.5% of the population has been injured in mine or UXO incidents. An ICRC survey in 1990 determined that 69% of the injured were walking on paths at the time of the blast, 15% on roads, and 16% in inhabitated areas. Angola has the highest number of amputees in the world, estimated at 70,000 in the UN's 1995 Angola Appeal. The ICRC has a rehabilitation center in Bomba Alto, where 11 staff manufacture prosthesis. Between Jan-Nov. 90, 631 new patients were fitted with prosthesis at the center, and a total of 1,127 prostheses were manufactured there for the year.

Background The end of the Cold War did not restore peace or order to this mineral rich country located in south-west Africa. Angola is 1,246,700 sq kms in area, bordered by Namibia, Zaire, Zambia and Congo. The capital city is Luanda. There are 18 provinces. The estimated population of 12,178,000 is matched by the presence of an estimated 9-15 million landmines.  The sowing of mines began in the 1960s when Portugal bitterly resisted anti-colonial movements, of which the most important were MPLA (Popular Front for the Liberation of Angola), led by Jose Eduardo Santos, and UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), led by Jonas Savimbi. The end of Portugese rule in 1975 was followed by economic collapse, civil war and military intervention by the super-powers and regional neighbors, all with an eye on Angola's extensive oil and mineral reserves.  ""While Portugese, Cuban and South African forces are known to have deployed landmines during operations in Angola, the overwhelming responsibility for landmines use lies with UNITA and the Angolan Army (FAPLA),"" report authors Roberts and Williams in After the Guns Fall Silent: The Enduring Legacy of Landmines.  Africa Watch reports that mines were an integral part of UNITA's hit-and-run war strategy: ""At one time or another, almost every part of the country was affected, as the foci of battle rapidly shifted backwards and forwards. Because of this mobility, the disruption of land communications was a major aim of UNITA, and the mining of roads, paths and bridges was consequently an important strategy."" The rebels also preferred to deploy anti-handling devices, and laid mines at random, unmarked.  In Lisbon, on 31 May 91, peace accords were signed between the MPLA and UNITA leaders as famine stalked the countryside. National elections were held under UN supervision between 29-30 Sep. 92. UNITA refused to concede defeat to the MPLA. The peace process was scuttled and war resumed.  Over the next two years, much of Angola was ruined. Over 3 million people were left dependent on food aid or humanitarian assistance. In Mar. 93 the Security Council authorized the creation of the Humanitarian Assistance Cooperation Unit (UCAH) to coordinate aid relief. On 20 Nov. 94 the Lusaka Protocol was signed, allowing for a ceasefire. UNITA accepted the election results and the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNIVEM III) began one of the most ambitious humanitarian intervention operations in history.  Mine notes Relief workers estimate there to be 34 types of landmines in Angola. There are many Russian-made mines, including the TMN-46, PMD-7-TS, M-19, PP-MI-SP, and the POMZ-2 anti-personnel mine. Activated by a tripwire, the POMZ-2 is stake mounted; rotting stakes pose a special hazard for deminers. The American M-18A1 mine has been found in Angola; with a kill radius of 50 meters, it releases 700 steel balls to cause maximum damage. The TMA-3, made in Yugoslavia, is an anti-tank mine that is non-detectable with hand-held metallic detectors (there is no metallic content in the mine fuse or body).

83,25787,[12033],['Mine Action'],Azerbaijan - Landmines Country Report,"Overview SITUATION - Dec. 95 - The disputed territory of Nagorno Karabakh, torn by five years of war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, has a serious mine problem. Nagorno Karabakh is a recognised part of Azeri territory, but the majority of inhabitants are Armenian, and the Azeris occupy only a small parcel of the area. The land mine problem was especially evident in the summer of 1994, when a lull in fighting allowed time for the harvest. At least 10 people were killed and many more injured by exploding mines while working in the fields, reported the Tass News Agency (23 Aug. 94). Mines seriously affect farm work throughout Nagorno Karabakh, reports the territory's Minister of Agriculture.

Nagorno Karabakh is a recognised part of Azeri territory, but the majority of inhabitants are Armenian, and the Azeris occupy only a small parcel of the area. The land mine problem was especially evident in the summer of 1994, when a lull in fighting allowed time for the harvest. At least 10 people were killed and many more injured by exploding mines while working in the fields, reported the Tass News Agency (23 Aug. 94). Mines seriously affect farm work throughout Nagorno Karabakh, reports the territory's Minister of Agriculture. He also told Tass that demining by self-defense units would help increase the arable area by 20%.

EAST AFRICA 1: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA 1. BURUNDI 1.1 The Burundi/Zairian border remains closed. 1.2 The interior of the country remains troubled with sporadic fighting in Cibitoke, Bururi, Kayanza, Karuzi, Bujumbura and Bujumbura Rural. Skirmishes between military and rebel forces in these provinces over the past week have lead to casualties and many injured. The security situation in Gitega is worsening dramatically and is seriously affected with a high death toll in the Swahili neighbourhood of the town centre. 1.3 Southern areas in Kayanza province remain entirely inaccessible. Planned distributions in Buraniro (1,048 beneficiaries) and Gasenyi (5,833 beneficiaries) had to be cancelled until further notice, following evacuation of MSF-Holland staff. Distributions in Gahombo (436 beneficiaries) and Muhanga (6,413 beneficiaries) were carried out. 1.4 The French school in Bujumbura is closing, and all French military personnel in the country are to leave by 2 June; the rest of the French community although not being evacuated are being advised to leave. No official reason was given but it is assumed to be for security reasons. 1.5 Total caseload in Gitega province estimated at 90,779 beneficiaries. Since the initiation of ad hoc distributions in April, WFP has covered more than 76 per cent of needs (69,311 beneficiaries/544 mt food). 1.6 On 21 May, a manifestation of 800 people organized by the Union for National Progress (UPRONA) party was held in Bujumbura, calling for the closure of the office of the UN Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG) and protesting against all foreign military operations in the region. 1.7 The Great Lakes Regional Meeting on Refugee Issues in Geneva has ended. Its main recommendation is an intensified information campaign within the refugee camps to promote repatriation. 1.8 No tangible effect on repatriation outflow of Rwandan refugees from Burundi reported as an outcome of the visit of the Tripartite Commission on Repatriation of Rwandan Refugees. Only about 200 Rwandan refugees have repatriated this week. The last transfer of Rwandan refugees from Rukuramigabo camp is scheduled 29 May. Transfer of 3,660 refugees from Kibezi camp to Magara camp in Ngozi is under way and should be completed by end of month. 2. ZAIRE - GOMA 2.1 Fighting continues in Masisi region. In response to heavy military losses, the Forces Armes Zairoises (FAZ) launched operation Mbata (""slap"") against Nigilima in Rutshuru area. According to the military authorities, over 100 Nigilima militia and civilians have been killed. A tea plantation in a Hunde and Nandi village near Mweso has been surrounded by Hutu who are expected to attack the village in the next few days. 2.2 Tutsis from Motoko (site of a serious attack early in the week of 12 May, in which an unknown number of people were killed), who had fled to Kichanga, have now started moving towards the Rwanda border at Gisenyi. An estimated 1,000 of this group have been transported to within one kilometre of the border by private means. 2.3 A WFP vehicle carrying three staff members was attacked near the airport military aviation unit on 23 May. Equipment and personal belongings were stolen but later returned. 2.4 Following the ambush of vehicles reported last week, CARE did not permit their social services personnel to go to the camps. In additions, inter-camp transfers were interrupted for two days when CARE restricted movements of trucking fleet due to concerns about insecurity on the corridor north of Goma. 2.5 Repair work is progressing along the Ishasha road, which is once again open to WFP trucks. The bridge at Puzi is still under repair. WFP is rebuilding stock levels as a result of the Ishasha road being reopened to traffic. 3. ZAIRE - BUKAVU 3.1 The security situation in Inera camp continues to beprecarious. Fourteen refugees from this camp were transferred to Kinshasa, charged with intimidating refugees against repatriation. 3.2 On Idjwi Island several security incidents reported between the local population and the refugees. 3.3 Two local NGOs, Adi Kivu (supported by CARITAS) and Nyakavogo, carried out their first direct distribution to heads of households 20-26 May. 18 out of 24 camps now distribute rations directly to heads of households. 4. ZAIRE - UVIRA 4.1 Problems with fuel supplies for humanitarian agencies in Uvira seem to have been solved, as a special delivery to Bukavu is planned for UNHCR and its partners. Supplies of fuel for WFP (for generators and light vehicles) are being ensured from barge tanks. 5. TANZANIA 5.1 Owing to border closure (to refugee movements) between Tanzania and Burundi, UNHCR is unable to provide accurate figures of new Burundian arrivals into Ngara region. However, an estimated daily average of 80 to 100 persons is reported. 5.2 The Government of Tanzania and UNHCR have informed refugees that the restriction on movement to a maximum of four kilometres outside the camps (to be effected in Ngara camps from 1 July) means that refugees are no longer allowed to live in neighbouring villages. The move will also affect farming activities. 5.3 Following discussions on caseload figures in the Karagwe camps, WFP, UNHCR and camp management have agreed to a total of 124,046 persons as an official caseload figure for the camps in the region. 5.4 The community food distribution system, now used in the Karagwe camps, is to be adopted in the Kigoma camps. 5.5 As of 26 May, the refugee population is reported as being 638,450. 6. RWANDA 6.1 Transit centres in Rwanda received 720 returnees from 21 to 27 May, confirming the downward trend in the level of refugees returning to Rwanda. 6.2 Some 817 Zairian refugees arrived in Rwanda 21-27 May. UNHCR reports from Zaire continue to speak about a possible influx of an additional 6,000 people who are currently displaced in the Goma area.

EAST AFRICA 1: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA 1. REGIONAL 1.1 The WFP Assistant Executive Director, Mr. Jean-Jacques Graisse, visited the sub-region 11-15 June. Mr. Graisse met WFP staff and humanitarian organisation representatives in Kigali, Bukavu, Bujumbura and Ngozi and held several official meetings in all countries visited. In a meeting with the President of Burundi Mr. Graisse reconfirmed that WFP will remain in Burundi, carrying out necessary operations as long as security conditions permit. The Assistant Executive Director also had the opportunity to look at WFP sponsored food-for-work projects in housing construction in Rwanda and the warehouses and the camps of Inera and Kashusha in Bukavu. 2. BURUNDI 2.1 A grenade exploded at the site of a food distribution in the Rukuramigabo camp in Kirundo province on 13 June. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, UNHCR/WFP implementing partner, was carrying out food distributions at the time of the explosion, which resulted in some 68 wounded, five of whom are in critical condition. 2.2 Most NGOs have restarted activities at the end of a week of mourning for the International Committee of the Red Cross delegates killed on 4 June. WFP activities have continued in Ngozi and Bujumbura, and will recommence in Gitega 19 June, two days later than anticipated, due to technical problems with the Twin Otter aircraft. 2.3 Security incidents continue throughout the country. On 13 June, in Rutegama (Muramvya province) between 70 and 100 civilians are reported to have been killed. Several houses were burned on 14 June in Kibimba hill. 2.4 Kabezi commune of Bujumbura Rural has been the site of a series of attacks since early June. Approximately 50 persons were killed on 12 June. A large portion of the population has gathered at the administrative centre of the commune and around the parish of Mutambu (Masama, Kitenga, Citwe). The areas of Migera, Ramba and Mutumba are presently empty of inhabitants. Insecurity has prevented WFP from delivering 30 mt food commodities for the 5,000 beneficiaries. The Matambu parish collected 24 mt, part delivered to the commune of Kabezi, while the remaining distributed directly to dispersed persons around Mutambu parish. An additional 6 mt will be delivered on 19 June to IDPs at Masama, Kitenga and Citwe. CRS will distribute non-food items to 3,800 persons. 2.5 Italian volunteers, nuns and priests living and working at the Parish of Mutoyi in Ruyigi province were evacuated from the area on 16 June following attacks which took place on 11 June, and threats on their lives. The Butezi hospital and six surrounding health centres have been emptied. 2.6 The office of Action Contre la Faim was looted in Ngozi marking the second attack in ten days. Action Contre la Faim has temporarily suspended some of its activities. 2.7 As a direct result of the grenade explosion in the Rukuramigabo camp, and other security incidents in the northern refugee camps, WFP/UNHCR have agreed to move distribution cycles from every two weeks to once every month in Rukuramigabo camp, and once every three weeks in the other three camps (Ruvumu, Kibezi and Magara) in Ngozi. 2.8 Two French nationals were victims of armed attacks in Bujumbura and were evacuated for medical treatment in France. 2.9 The third round of Mwanza peace talks in Tanzania, with the participation of representatives from 18 of Burundi's political parties as well as representatives from the Presidency and the Bureau of the Prime Minister, began on 17 June, one week after the last round ended. Talks were expected to last for two days. 3. ZAIRE - GOMA 3.1 The general security situation remains tense in Goma. Zairian Contingent soldiers found two mines on the north corridor 8 km south of Kibumba camp. 3.2 Following a prolonged calm in Masisi central, the Hunde are returning in large numbers in military-escorted convoys. 3.3 Most of the Tutsi population has left the Kichanga area in Masisi for Rwanda. 3.4 Several civilians and some rebels were reported killed in skirmishes between the military involved in the Mbata (""slap"") campaign and the Ngilima rebels in the Rutshuru area. 3.5 WFP reopened the Bunagana office on 16 June (closed on 5 June following attack on the Bunagana village). At present, the Bunagana border area is quiet, but the local military remain uneasy about the security situation along this route. 3.6 UNHCR has postponed the census in the Goma camps to August 1996. 3.7 A total of 86 trucks crossed the Bunagana border from 10-16 June. WFP-Goma received a total of 2,296 mt and dispatched 530 mt by barge to Bukavu. 4. ZAIRE - BUKAVU 4.1 The registration operation, which began during the week of 3-9 June, continued in several camps. In other camps, the operation was suspended due to cheating. Food delivery last week was carried out only in camps where the registration operation was completed and the results were approved. WFP and UNHCR have announced to the refugees that in camps where population figures are still not agreed upon food will not be delivered until the matter is resolved. 4.2 The numerous security incidents near Goma reported over the last several weeks hampered to some degree WFP's ability to maintain a steady flow of food deliveries to Goma and Bukavu via the northern corridor. 5. ZAIRE - UVIRA 5.1 Zairian border with Burundi remains closed. WFP continues enhanced Kigoma-Uvira barge operation to ensure continuity of Uvira and Bukavu pipeline. Some 3,770 mt food commodities on three barges is presently being loaded in Kigoma for Uvira. These barges are booked for two rotations, which will enable a total uplift of 5,900 mt from Kigoma in the next two weeks. This barge capacity will help to significantly reduce the current stock build-up in the port of Kigoma. This build-up has been primarily due to increased barge activity on the lake, and subsequent increased competition for available capacity, resulting from the Burundi/Zaire border closure. 5.2 New sites have been identified by UNHCR in Uvira for a possible influx of refugees from Burundi, with an estimated operational capacity of 90,000 persons. 5.3 Population in Uvira camps is at 189,144 (117,316 Burundian and 71,828 Rwandan). 6. TANZANIA 6.1 New arrivals have brought the refugee population of Keza camp to 40,689, and the camp, established to accommodate new refugees temporarily until their relocation to other camps, is reaching full capacity. 6.2 During the reporting week the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the Tanzanian Red Cross Society officially handed over Keza camp management to the International Refugee Committee. 6.3 Kigoma region continues to receive new arrivals. A total of 501 refugees arrived during the reporting period. 280 entered through Kanembwa, the remainder through Mtabila. 7. RWANDA 7.1 The last week witnessed a number of security incidents in Kibuye (detection of new anti-tank mines on roads), Gikongoro (sporadic cases of insurgency and land mines) and the north- east (sabotage of a water facility in Tabagwe). 7.2 Following a decision made last week by the UN Security Coordinator for Rwanda, the UN agencies have started using the road through Nyungwe forest (between Gikongoro and Cyangugu) only in organised convoys. Several convoys have already passed without incidents and are expected to continue at least three times a week. 7.3 The Prefects of the two most tense Prefectures of Rwanda, Cyangugu and Gisenyi, were replaced last week, reportedly due to their unsatisfactory conduct in security matters. 7.4 A total of 1,040 Zairian refugees entered Rwanda last week, bringing the 1996 total to 13,984 persons. The majority of the refugees are assisted in Umubano camp in Gisenyi, 1,324 await transfer from Nkamira returnee centre and 1,300 from the former CARE transit centre. The previous week some 570 Zairian refugees had arrived. 7.5 Owing to the general poor health and nutritional condition of the Umubano camp population, WFP will increase the general food aid ration by 100 gr of beans per person daily, raising the kilocalorie content to 2,314. EC will provide the additional quantities of food required. Following two to three months of increased distributions, the nutritional situation in the camp will be re-assessed.","WFP Emergency Report No. 24 of 1996: East Africa B.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, UNHCR/WFP implementing partner, was carrying out food distributions at the time of the explosion, which resulted in some 68 wounded, five of whom are in critical condition. 2.2 Most NGOs have restarted activities at the end of a week of mourning for the International Committee of the Red Cross delegates killed on 4 June. WFP activities have continued in Ngozi and Bujumbura, and will recommence in Gitega 19 June, two days later than anticipated, due to technical problems with the Twin Otter aircraft. 2.3 Security incidents continue throughout the country. On 13 June, in Rutegama (Muramvya province) between 70 and 100 civilians are reported to have been killed. Several houses were burned on 14 June in Kibimba hill. 2.4 Kabezi commune of Bujumbura Rural has been the site of a series of attacks since early June. Approximately 50 persons were killed on 12 June. A large portion of the population has gathered at the administrative centre of the commune and around the parish of Mutambu (Masama, Kitenga, Citwe). The areas of Migera, Ramba and Mutumba are presently empty of inhabitants. Insecurity has prevented WFP from delivering 30 mt food commodities for the 5,000 beneficiaries. The Matambu parish collected 24 mt, part delivered to the commune of Kabezi, while the remaining distributed directly to dispersed persons around Mutambu parish. An additional 6 mt will be delivered on 19 June to IDPs at Masama, Kitenga and Citwe. CRS will distribute non-food items to 3,800 persons. 2.5 Italian volunteers, nuns and priests living and working at the Parish of Mutoyi in Ruyigi province were evacuated from the area on 16 June following attacks which took place on 11 June, and threats on their lives. The Butezi hospital and six surrounding health centres have been emptied. 2.6 The office of Action Contre la Faim was looted in Ngozi marking the second attack in ten days. Action Contre la Faim has temporarily suspended some of its activities. 2.7 As a direct result of the grenade explosion in the Rukuramigabo camp, and other security incidents in the northern refugee camps, WFP/UNHCR have agreed to move distribution cycles from every two weeks to once every month in Rukuramigabo camp, and once every three weeks in the other three camps (Ruvumu, Kibezi and Magara) in Ngozi. 2.8 Two French nationals were victims of armed attacks in Bujumbura and were evacuated for medical treatment in France. 2.9 The third round of Mwanza peace talks in Tanzania, with the participation of representatives from 18 of Burundi's political parties as well as representatives from the Presidency and the Bureau of the Prime Minister, began on 17 June, one week after the last round ended. Talks were expected to last for two days. 3. ZAIRE - GOMA 3.1 The general security situation remains tense in Goma. Zairian Contingent soldiers found two mines on the north corridor 8 km south of Kibumba camp. 3.2 Following a prolonged calm in Masisi central, the Hunde are returning in large numbers in military-escorted convoys. 3.3 Most of the Tutsi population has left the Kichanga area in Masisi for Rwanda. 3.4 Several civilians and some rebels were reported killed in skirmishes between the military involved in the Mbata (""slap"") campaign and the Ngilima rebels in the Rutshuru area. 3.5 WFP reopened the Bunagana office on 16 June (closed on 5 June following attack on the Bunagana village). At present, the Bunagana border area is quiet, but the local military remain uneasy about the security situation along this route. 3.6 UNHCR has postponed the census in the Goma camps to August 1996. 3.7 A total of 86 trucks crossed the Bunagana border from 10-16 June. WFP-Goma received a total of 2,296 mt and dispatched 530 mt by barge to Bukavu. 4. ZAIRE - BUKAVU 4.1 The registration operation, which began during the week of 3-9 June, continued in several camps. In other camps, the operation was suspended due to cheating. Food delivery last week was carried out only in camps where the registration operation was completed and the results were approved. WFP and UNHCR have announced to the refugees that in camps where population figures are still not agreed upon food will not be delivered until the matter is resolved. 4.2 The numerous security incidents near Goma reported over the last several weeks hampered to some degree WFP's ability to maintain a steady flow of food deliveries to Goma and Bukavu via the northern corridor. 5. ZAIRE - UVIRA 5.1 Zairian border with Burundi remains closed. WFP continues enhanced Kigoma-Uvira barge operation to ensure continuity of Uvira and Bukavu pipeline. Some 3,770 mt food commodities on three barges is presently being loaded in Kigoma for Uvira. These barges are booked for two rotations, which will enable a total uplift of 5,900 mt from Kigoma in the next two weeks. This barge capacity will help to significantly reduce the current stock build-up in the port of Kigoma. This build-up has been primarily due to increased barge activity on the lake, and subsequent increased competition for available capacity, resulting from the Burundi/Zaire border closure. 5.2 New sites have been identified by UNHCR in Uvira for a possible influx of refugees from Burundi, with an estimated operational capacity of 90,000 persons. 5.3 Population in Uvira camps is at 189,144 (117,316 Burundian and 71,828 Rwandan). 6. TANZANIA 6.1 New arrivals have brought the refugee population of Keza camp to 40,689, and the camp, established to accommodate new refugees temporarily until their relocation to other camps, is reaching full capacity. 6.2 During the reporting week the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the Tanzanian Red Cross Society officially handed over Keza camp management to the International Refugee Committee. 6.3 Kigoma region continues to receive new arrivals. A total of 501 refugees arrived during the reporting period. 280 entered through Kanembwa, the remainder through Mtabila. 7. RWANDA 7.1 The last week witnessed a number of security incidents in Kibuye (detection of new anti-tank mines on roads), Gikongoro (sporadic cases of insurgency and land mines) and the north- east (sabotage of a water facility in Tabagwe). 7.2 Following a decision made last week by the UN Security Coordinator for Rwanda, the UN agencies have started using the road through Nyungwe forest (between Gikongoro and Cyangugu) only in organised convoys. Several convoys have already passed without incidents and are expected to continue at least three times a week. 7.3 The Prefects of the two most tense Prefectures of Rwanda, Cyangugu and Gisenyi, were replaced last week, reportedly due to their unsatisfactory conduct in security matters. 7.4 A total of 1,040 Zairian refugees entered Rwanda last week, bringing the 1996 total to 13,984 persons. The majority of the refugees are assisted in Umubano camp in Gisenyi, 1,324 await transfer from Nkamira returnee centre and 1,300 from the former CARE transit centre. The previous week some 570 Zairian refugees had arrived. 7.5 Owing to the general poor health and nutritional condition of the Umubano camp population, WFP will increase the general food aid ration by 100 gr of beans per person daily, raising the kilocalorie content to 2,314. EC will provide the additional quantities of food required. Following two to three months of increased distributions, the nutritional situation in the camp will be re-assessed.",https://reliefweb.int/node/25998,-1.87,29.92,rwa,Rwanda,1996-06-21T04:00:00+00:00,1741,World Food Programme,Situation Report,1528.0
91,26051,[4589],['Contributions'],Canada and Burundi,"Background Situated in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa, Burundi covers an area of about 28,000 square kilometres. Its population of just over six million is divided into two ethnic groups: the majority Hutus and the minority Tutsis, who have nevertheless traditionally held power. Burundi is the most densely populated African country after Rwanda. Its people speak Kinyarundi and French. It is an almost exclusively agricultural country of high plateaus. Nearly 92% of the labour force is employed in agriculture, especially in growing coffee, tea and cotton. The remaining economic activity is based largely on nickel and phosphate mining. There is virtually no processing industry. Over-development, land fragmentation, deforestation and soil erosion are other problems that seriously threaten agriculture and forestry. As in most Central African countries, the prevalence of HIV remains very high, especially in Bujumbura. Despite significant progress in education since the country's independence, nearly half of children between seven and 12 years of age do not attend primary school. Most women are illiterate and unable to participate fully in the economic and social development of Burundi society. Health services are inadequate, and there is only one doctor for every 25,000 inhabitants. According to UNICEF, moreover, only 70% of the population has access to potable water, and less than one third has access to electricity. Burundi became independent from Belgium in 1962. In recent decades, it has experienced significant internal difficulties and fratricidal struggles that have led thousands of Burundis to take refuge in neighbouring countries. The situation has worsened considerably since President Melchior Ndadaye was assassinated on October 21, 1993, and the country is in the throes of an unprecedented political crisis. It is estimated that more than 250,000 Burundis have sought refuge in bordering countries, not including another 100,000 displaced within Burundi. The Convention on Government of September 1994, which calls for the sharing of power between the majority Hutus and the minority Tutsis, has been undermined by extremists on both sides. Tutsi militias have expelled Hutus from the mixed neighbourhoods of Bujumbura, the nation's capital. Hutu militias, based in Zaire and supported by the army of the former government of Rwanda, are leading a growing rebellion. A state of emergency was declared on June 18, 1995, in an attempt to avoid civil war. Since February 1995, the international community has sought to bring about a settlement of the conflict by focusing its efforts on preventive diplomacy and trying to convince Burundi leaders to find a peaceful solution to the crisis. Canada supports this approach. All of this upheaval has seriously affected Burundi's economy. Burundi is one of the world's poorest countries, and its leaders are finding it very difficult to get the economy moving again. The present conflict is beginning to have an impact on the Government of Burundi's financial management. Relations between Canada and Burundi Canada has maintained diplomatic relations with Burundi since 1969. However, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has been active in Burundi since the country's independence in the early 1960s. Burundi has an embassy in Ottawa, and Canada has a consulate in Bujumbura, directed by an honorary consul. Canada's High Commissioner in Nairobi, Kenya, is accredited to Burundi. In February 1995, Mrs. Christine Stewart, Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), led the Canadian delegation to the Regional Conference on Assistance to Refugees, Returnees and Displaced Persons in the Great Lakes Region of Africa, in Bujumbura. On Canada's initiative, participants at the conference agreed to lend their unconditional support to Burundi's democratic political forces, to produce a declaration defending the power-sharing agreement, and to support the president's request for a judicial inquiry by the United Nations into the assassination of President Ndadaye. At the meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of La Francophonie in Paris on March 30, 1995, Canada proposed that the organization assume a more active role in preventive diplomacy in Central Africa. Thus, a joint delegation of representatives from the Francophone Ministers' Conference, the International Association of French-Speaking Parliamentarians, the Permanent Council of La Francophonie, and the Cultural and Technical Cooperation Agency visited Burundi from April 12 to 15 to show that francophone countries supported the government's moderate leadership and to condemn the actions of extremists. Three members of the Canadian Armed Forces were sent to Burundi in March 1995 to give a three-week course on human rights to members of Burundi's armed forces, sponsored by the UN Centre for Human Rights. In July 1994, to contribute to the search for sustainable solutions to the problems of Burundi and the region, Canada appointed Ambassador Bernard Dussault as special envoy to Central Africa. Mr. Dussault undertook several missions to the governments of the region, the Organization of African Unity, the UN agencies concerned and the governments of donor countries. Humanitarian and Development Assistance On September 24, 1990, the Canadian International Development Agency signed a co-operation agreement with Burundi authorities. Under this agreement, Canada made a commitment to provide substantial humanitarian and technical assistance to Burundi, and to work to improve the country's infrastructure. Key areas of co-operation were education, village water supply and energy. In February 1993, the bilateral aid program in Burundi had to be suspended as a result of budget cuts affecting several CIDA assistance programs. However, the Agency continued to assist Burundi's poorest through its multilateral program. A $500,000 fund was also created in July 1994 to support projects promoting respect for human rights and democratic development in Burundi. As a result of the current fragile political situation in Burundi, Canada is focusing its efforts on humanitarian assistance and democratic development programs. Since the political crisis erupted in October 1993, CIDA has disbursed over $14 million in humanitarian assistance. These funds were disbursed to international organizations and Canadian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to assist the victims of the conflict, particularly abandoned children, and to facilitate the return of refugees and displaced persons. Canada has also provided emergency humanitarian assistance to supply food and potable water. CIDA is currently working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Burundi authorities to develop a Canadian intervention strategy to respond to the present crisis. On June 17 and 18 in Geneva, with other agencies from a dozen countries and several international organizations, the Agency will also examine the key components of a possible development assistance program for the short-, medium- and long-term reconstruction of Burundi. The meeting will also allow an examination of possible initiatives to resolve the conflict and to put Burundi on the road to sustainable peace. A small number of Canadian NGOs and religious organizations have also worked in Burundi since the early 1960s. They specialize mainly in vocational training and assistance to the poorest, and receive support from CIDA. Consular Assistance In late May 1996, there were 87 Canadians registered in Burundi, 75 of them in Bujumbura. This number includes missionaries and employees of NGOs dedicated to humanitarian assistance. A consular warning is in effect, recommending that Canadians postpone their plans to travel to Burundi. Canadians living in Burundi are being encouraged to leave the country immediately by the safest means. An emergency radio system is in place at the Canadian consulate in Bujumbura to ensure contact with Canadian nationals in Burundi. Immigration Measures No special program has been developed for Burundi refugees, since international organizations encourage refugees to return to their country instead of settling in a third country. However, the visa department of Canada's High Commission in Nairobi, Kenya, continues to handle the claims of refugees sponsored by private groups.

92,26779,[49458],['Camp Coordination and Camp Management'],CARE Emergency Update - Burundi,"by Clarice Taylor,  CARE Emergency Assistance Unit Information Officer  BURUNDI Beleaguered by civil conflict for the past three years, Burundi was the scene of a bloodless coup d'etat on July 24. After being pelted by stones at the funeral of Tutsi women and children, President Ntibantunganya, the constitutional Head of State, took refuge at the residence of the American Ambassador. The following day, Pierre Buyoya, the former Tutsi President who led Burundi to democratic elections in 1993, was named interim president. The overthrow of the coalition Government which ruled the country since 1993, had been brewing for several days with the collapse of a fragile power-sharing agreement called the ""Convention du Government.""  Despite early pronouncements by some western governments, including the United States, that any government which came to power through the use of force would not be recognized, ther appears to be a tentative opening to Mr. Buyoya's presidency. He is seen as a moderate who could prove to be a stabilizing influence in the ongoing war of ethnic violence and retribution. However, the Organization for African Unity (OAU) condemned the coup and refused to acknowledge Buyoya's presidency. In addition, at a meeting on July 31 in Arusha, the majority of the leaders of Great Lakes countries called for economic sanctions against Burundi. And there is concern among several international agencies, including CARE, that sanctions be carefully targeted to affect the belligerents rather than placing the burden on the poor, as happened in Haiti.  Security remains a very real concern in Burundi. Following the murder of three International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) staff in June, relief agencies, including CARE, temporarily suspended operations in a show of solidarity. The closure of the Burundi-Zaire border in May 1996 has resulted in an increased difficulty in managing the our Uvira operations from the Burundi/Bujumbura office. In the Uvira camps, CARE is involved in most aspects of camp management: warehouse management for non-food items; road rehabilitation; food distribution to the entire camp population. Currently, that number is at about 190,000 refugees (this figure includes some 70,000 Rwandans), and the arrival over the past two months of an additional 50,000 refugees has prompted the UN to explore a new site. In spite of constraints, CARE continues its program activities inside Burundi. CARE's provision of shelter and water to internally displaced persons and local residents also attempts to bring together divided communities by working on very concrete common goals. As funding becomes more difficult to access because of the security environment, the CARE's Emergency Group has sought to support CARE- Burundi in its efforts to secure funding needed to continue and expand its work.

Serious security incidents in and around the camps have also fallen off. 3.2 Two WFP truck drivers were robbed at gunpoint on theaccess road to Goma port on Lake Kivu after their trucks were unloaded at the port. 3.3 The situation in the Masisi area is relatively calm. Villagers are continuing to return their home villages. However, the villagers are returning to destroyed and pillaged homes, all their livestock stolen or slaughtered, and fields neglected. Insecurity is still a problem in parts of the area, with incidents reported in Bitonga in the south and Mweso in the north. In Bitonga, a reported Hutu attack on Hunde villages lasted four days and resulted in 35 deaths and 3,000 displaced. 3.4 Firewood provision to the camps is improving with the gradual calming of the security situation in the region and the opening of the Goma-Butembo road. 3.5 The results of a nutritional survey in Kibumba camp have shown a significant improvement. The 8.3 percent of global malnutrition found in November 1995 fell to 3.5 percent in July 1996. A nutritional survey in the fifth and final camp took place on 15 July. Results should be available next reporting week. 3.6 From 8 to 14 July WFP Goma received a total of 2,993 mt of commodities. A total of 543 mt were dispatched to Bukavu. 4. ZAIRE - BUKAVU 4.1 A grenade exploded in Inera camp on 10 July killing a woman and a girl and seriously injuring several others. 4.2 On 12 July Zairian soldiers guarding the escarpment road which leads to Uvira returned fire on Rwanda after reportedly heavy artillery fire from across the border was directed on trucks and buses travelling the Zairian road. However this has not affected the delivery of relief food to Bukavu. 4.3 The general caseload for the Bukavu camps has been temporarily set at 294,978 beneficiaries. Verification of population figures goes ahead slowly in the camps. WFP Bukavu is monitoring the operation very closely to ensure the validity of the final figures. 4.4 Delivery of rations except for CSB completed in all camps except for Kabira and Nyamirangwe which were on stand-by for a verification of population figures and are scheduled for deliveries next week. CSB will be delivered to all camps once received. 4.5 Reception of food aid supplies almost doubled compared to previous week due to a continued increasing flow of food from the northern route and an increased capacity of WFP-leased trucks on the southern route from Uvira. 5. ZAIRE - UVIRA 5.1 Up to 500 refugees from the Cibitoke area have been fleeing to Uvira daily over the period 10-16 July. 5.2 Official refugee population in Uvira now totals 191,922 persons. This figure reflects the results of the census operation in all eleven camps as well as the recent arrival of some 6,000 new refugees. 6. TANZANIA 6.1 A new camp, called Mtendele, opened in Kibondo district to accommodate new arrivals from Burundi. The camp, which is located 2.5 km from the Kibondo-Nyakanazi road, has a current population of 288 refugees. A Tanzanian NGO will be responsible for food distribution and camp management, while the International Refugee Committee will cover health and sanitation services for refugees. 6.2 UNHCR, the Ministry of Home Affairs and NGOs are studying the possibility of opening a new camp in Kasulu district for the continuing flow of Burundian refugees into that area. 6.3 A total of 445 Burundian refugees arrived between 8 and 14 July and were registered at Mtabila and Kanembwa camps in the Kigoma region. 6.4 Total refugee population as at 14 July is 644,267. 7. RWANDA 7.1 FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission Report concluded and released. Similar to the findings of the preceding season, an increase of 7 percent was noted in the planted area. This reflects improved stability in the interior of Rwanda and resumption of regular agricultural activities by a considerable number of returning refugees. The Mission estimated the output of this season (1996 B) to be 181,000 mt (cereals and pulses). Import requirements total 64,000 mt ofwhich some 44,000 mt is required as food aid. Food production for the whole of 1996 is estimated to be 15 percent higher than in 1995 but still remains 23 percent below pre-crisis level in 1990. In terms of per capita production, considering the smaller number of people in 1996, this year's result is 14 percent below the 1990 level. 7.2 A WFP Management Review Mission is scheduled for September 1996. Issues to be reviewed will include level of assistance and overall programming matters. 7.3 During the past week high government officials (Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Interior and Agriculture Ministers and Parliament members) paid visits to Cyangugu, Gisenyi and Kibuye. Security and the refugee situation were the main items on the agenda. 7.4 Human rights agencies in Rwanda reported that the month of June witnessed a record increase in numbers of attacks on genocide survivors and witnesses. The total for 1996 is 98 attacks with at least 80 casualties. In Kibuye and Cyangugu, a move of survivors from imminent border areas deeper into the interior has been noticed as a consequence. The President of Rwanda has pledged that the Government will make new efforts to support and protect these vulnerable groups. 7.5 Caseload of the supplementary feeding programme for Masisi refugees is anticipated to rise from current 1,400 beneficiaries to around 2,000. WFP will continue to provide 1,000 food rations and CRS will supply the rest. 7.6 Zairian refugees continue to arrive to Gisenyi, though in much smaller numbers than before. 7.7 New refugees from Burundi also continue to arrive with some 500 persons registered between 9-15 July. There are currently 3,427 Burundian refugees located at Bugarama communal office (Cyangugu). UNHCR and the Government of Rwanda have agreed to a plan to move the camp to a new, more permanent site (also in Bugarama). WFP continues to provide food to all refugees through communal kitchens established and run by the NGO Concern. Ninety unaccompanied children among the refugees are cared for separately.","WFP Emergency Report No. 28 of 1996: East Africa This report includes: A) Burundi, Rwanda, Zaire and Tanzania B) Uganda and Sudan C) Liberia.

In Rutovu commune of Bururi province, a grenade exploded in an elementary school on 9 July resulting in a reported six deaths and 17 injuries. Ambushes continue in Cibitoke. In Muramvya, rebels attacked a cheese factory and an attack on a military-escorted convoy led to one soldier killed and another wounded. 2.2 Due to new reports of violence, including recent deaths of some 50 persons, in the Kabezi area of Bujumbura rural, WFP received a request from the local parish for food assistance for 12,252 persons. WFP is assessing the situation. 2.3 The situation in Buhinyuza and Mwakiro communes in Muyinga province is very tense; many areas are completely empty of inhabitants. 2.4 Regular WFP operations are still on hold in the Gitega/ Karuzi area due to insecurity, and all staff remain in Bujumbura. No further requests have been made to WFP for food assistance in either Gitega or Karuzi following recent distributions in both areas. 2.5 The Burundian members of the Technical Committee, in charge of studying the criteria for an intervention force as per the recommendations of the Arusha summit, met on 16 July and are expected to issue the conclusions of their report to the National Security Council by 20 July. This report will later be submitted to the International Technical Committee, presided by Julius Nyerere. 2.6 Demonstrations continue in Bujumbura protesting the proposed deployment of an international intervention force in Burundi.

95,26927,[12033],['Mine Action'],Demining Country Report: Iraq,"Update 26 Feb 96 - Iraq said its civil defence teams defused tens of thousands of bombs the U.S.-led coalition forces dropped over the southern province of Muthanna during their 1991 campaign to eject Iraqi troops from Kuwait. Five years after the end of the Gulf War over Kuwait, Iraqi newspapers publish periodic reports of mines either killing or wounding civilians, shepards and animals. (Source: Reuter)  7 Feb 96 - On 6 February, 870 items of unexploded ordnance were marked in 45 locations across the DMZ. With high winds and rain shifting both ordnance and markers, the risk of ordnance-related injury has been reported to be significant. The critical shortage of ordnance disposal explosives continues to be major safety concern within UNIKOM. (Source: UN/DPKO) Overview SITUATION - Dec. 95 - This report is specifically related to the mines problem in North Iraq, in particular the area referred to as Kurdistan. Intelligence on the situation there comes primarily from the Mines Advisory Group (MAG), active in demining there since May 1992. MAG has thus far cleared 20,777 landmines, 959,600 sqm of land, and 87,296 pieces of UXO.  North Iraq is seriously impacted by mines and UXO. Rae McGrath, writing in Refugee Participation Network in Mar. 94, reported that grazing livestock, collecting water and firewood, and scavenging, are the most mine vulnerable activities in northern Iraq. ""Firewood collection is possibly the highest risk occupation for all age groups in a mined environment,"" he rote. ""A common scenario is when a mother with several young children takes them with her to cut firewood, either to assist her or because they are too young to be left alone. Children become casualties either while helping to collect or carry wood or, in the case of younger children, by straying off tracks while the mother, loaded with wood, is unable to control them."" He noted with concern the rise of a ""land mine culture,"" which is strikingly similar to the situation in Cambodia, where land mines are an accepted component of daily life.  ""Children, especially young boys, have been known to start mine collections and may use common mines to swap for rare ones."" McGrath noted that part of the problem lay with mine awareness instructors handing out fake mines in refugee camps as teaching aids, and letting them ""fall into the hands of refugee children as collectors' items.""  In northern Iraq ""the risk of mine-related death and injury is compounded as resettlement and agricultural activity gather pace - the rehabilitation of the agricultural sector being essential to attaining long-term economic self-sufficiency (some 17% of arable land is under mines,"" reports the UN. In the border region, 50% of agricultural land can not be used. In the governate of Sulaimania 40% of land is uncultivated because of mines.  Casualties MAG's database has figures for casualties, compiled from major hospitals in the three governates of Suleimaniya, Erbil and Dohuk. The figures do not include unreported injuries and deaths occurring in more remote areas. Since 1991, according to hospital records, 2,126 people died, of which over 65% were male in all governates, with children making up the bulk of the remainder (minimum of 20% in the three governates). There were 3,651 injuries.  MAG reports that gathering wood, herding animals and smuggling are the most high risk activities. Chwarta has the highest injury figures in the governate of Suleimaniya with 672, compared to 647 in Penjwin and 424 in Halabja. These injury figures do not include mine or UXO deaths.  Handicap International reported that of the amputations performed by its surgeons between 16 Nov. 91 to 9 Feb. 92, 48.8% (408) were below the knee, and 16.7% (140) were above the knee. Also, ""about 30% of injuries die before reaching hospital from bleeding or abdominal injuries. Most of the rest are amputees."" Out of 810 casualties that resulted in handicaps, 59.2% (480) were caused by land mines, whereas only 7.1% (58) were caused by bullets. 728 were men and 82 were women.  Locations March 1996  The total number of minefields demarcated between March 1993 and October 1995 is 121 or 1,880,868 msq. In 1996, Mine Advisory Group (MAG) will be investigating how demarcation and minefield survey can be more closely linked with the community education programme. This will enhance the impact of the mine awareness messages as well as providing a practical response until such time as clearance can begin. Demarcation teams will have to expand accordingly. (Source: MAG)  The borders with Kuwait, Iran, Syria and Turkey are severely mined.  Disaster Aid Center/UK reports that there are 2.5 million mines in the governate of Dohuk. Save the Children estimates the figure to be near the 5 million mark.  Minefields: Areas in Erbil Governate already clearly marked to indicate mines include Sardekan Hill, Azadi, Derband, Nawpradan, Konyarasukosa, Shik Mowlan/Kandinowberger, Sirmin/Sinan, and Kandibokidera. Starting in the south, from the marshes towards the north, the main minefields in the north are: Khanaquin, Derbendikhan, Qaradagh, Halabja, Sherezor, Penjwin, Shanazeh, Merve, Qala Sholan, Mawat, Pijschder, Balisan, Haj Omran, Choman, Sidakan, Mirga Zor, barzan and Zakho Sahela.

There are four demarcation teams working, with four more being trained. They have surveyed 1216 minefields (Aug. 95). MAG reports that of these, 497 are Priority 1 tasks and 719 Priority 2. It takes the surveyers about 2 weeks to demark an average size minefield of 20,000 msq. Doubling the four teams means it should take 6-7 years to demarcate P1 and P2 minefields. MAG also believes, however, that there are a further 700 minefields to be surveyed, of which 450 will be P1 or P2.  MAG Demining: There are over 200 technical/disposal national staff, supplemented by five expatriate mine specialists and one explosive ordnance disposal expert. The seven demining teams and four EOD teams are working from five bases of operation. These are: Choman, Diyuna (site of the training camp), Halabja, Penjwin and Chwarta. MAG responds to local and NGO requests for mine and UXO clearance. The newest operation base in Chwarta, established Sep. 95, is approximately 1600 km sq, of which 17 km sq of 70 kms of agricultural land is mined.  MAG Mine Awareness: By Mar. 94 all villages in the governate of Suleimaniya had been reached by community mine awareness field officers (they have been in field since Sep. 92). People are taught to distinguish between mines and minefields with puppet shows, plays, songs, posters and videos. A schools programme runs through the Oct.-May school year.  Background Mine laying in northern Iraq began in the 1960s and continued throughout the 1970s in an effort by the central government to subdue Kurdish separatists. During the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran War, the north was mined for strategic purposes. ""Iraqi mine laying in their northern provinces was targeted both at the one-time Iranian foe and the local Kurdish population, whose lands and villages were thus made uninhabitable,"" writes Michael Griffin in Ceres. Mines were planted in irrigation ditches, grape or watermelon plantations, pasture land and forest margins.  According to one Iraqi sapper commander, his 20-man section laid between 80-100,000 AP and AT devices in the Zakho region, working flat-out over a 20-day period shortly after the invasion of Kuwait. There were 120 sections working simultaneously in the same area, reported Griffin. Another report has a team of military engineers laying 4-5,000 mines per day just below the earth's surface along the border with Iran. Many mines have a life-span of 45 years. It is estimated that a 120 strong company of army engineers could take 12 hours to lay 5,000 mines in one sq km. Millions of land mines were sown in southern Iraq during the Gulf War. Millions more were sown in Kurdistan during the Kurdish uprising which followed. And still more were left by Turkish Army units which entered Iraq in 1995 in hot pursuit of Kurdish rebels.  Mine notes The most common mines identified in Iraq are the Valmara 69 and the VS-50. They are manufactured by Italian arms manufacturer Valseall Meccanotecnica SPA of Brescis. Because of bans on doing business with Iraq, the company set up a new company in Singapore to obtain a trade and manufacturer's licence. Chartered Industries of Singapore, whose government has a stake in the company, produces identical mines to Valsella.  There are three types of minefields in Iraq:  1) Regular Minefields: Laid to ward off army attacks, they were laid in a pattern until 1987, when they were laid randomly. There are many Iranian regular minefields laid in southern Iraq.  2) Irregular Minefields: These were planted by engineers to channel population flows out of rebel territory. and disrupt community living. Farms, orchards and waterways were mined.  3) Military Defensive Minefields: Mines were laid to protect military checkpoints and installations.

Five years after the end of the Gulf War over Kuwait, Iraqi newspapers publish periodic reports of mines either killing or wounding civilians, shepards and animals. (Source: Reuter)  7 Feb 96 - On 6 February, 870 items of unexploded ordnance were marked in 45 locations across the DMZ. With high winds and rain shifting both ordnance and markers, the risk of ordnance-related injury has been reported to be significant. The critical shortage of ordnance disposal explosives continues to be major safety concern within UNIKOM. (Source: UN/DPKO) Overview SITUATION - Dec. 95 - This report is specifically related to the mines problem in North Iraq, in particular the area referred to as Kurdistan. Intelligence on the situation there comes primarily from the Mines Advisory Group (MAG), active in demining there since May 1992. MAG has thus far cleared 20,777 landmines, 959,600 sqm of land, and 87,296 pieces of UXO.  North Iraq is seriously impacted by mines and UXO. Rae McGrath, writing in Refugee Participation Network in Mar. 94, reported that grazing livestock, collecting water and firewood, and scavenging, are the most mine vulnerable activities in northern Iraq. ""Firewood collection is possibly the highest risk occupation for all age groups in a mined environment,"" he rote. ""A common scenario is when a mother with several young children takes them with her to cut firewood, either to assist her or because they are too young to be left alone. Children become casualties either while helping to collect or carry wood or, in the case of younger children, by straying off tracks while the mother, loaded with wood, is unable to control them."" He noted with concern the rise of a ""land mine culture,"" which is strikingly similar to the situation in Cambodia, where land mines are an accepted component of daily life.  ""Children, especially young boys, have been known to start mine collections and may use common mines to swap for rare ones."" McGrath noted that part of the problem lay with mine awareness instructors handing out fake mines in refugee camps as teaching aids, and letting them ""fall into the hands of refugee children as collectors' items.""  In northern Iraq ""the risk of mine-related death and injury is compounded as resettlement and agricultural activity gather pace - the rehabilitation of the agricultural sector being essential to attaining long-term economic self-sufficiency (some 17% of arable land is under mines,"" reports the UN. In the border region, 50% of agricultural land can not be used. In the governate of Sulaimania 40% of land is uncultivated because of mines.  Casualties MAG's database has figures for casualties, compiled from major hospitals in the three governates of Suleimaniya, Erbil and Dohuk. The figures do not include unreported injuries and deaths occurring in more remote areas. Since 1991, according to hospital records, 2,126 people died, of which over 65% were male in all governates, with children making up the bulk of the remainder (minimum of 20% in the three governates). There were 3,651 injuries.  MAG reports that gathering wood, herding animals and smuggling are the most high risk activities. Chwarta has the highest injury figures in the governate of Suleimaniya with 672, compared to 647 in Penjwin and 424 in Halabja. These injury figures do not include mine or UXO deaths.  Handicap International reported that of the amputations performed by its surgeons between 16 Nov. 91 to 9 Feb. 92, 48.8% (408) were below the knee, and 16.7% (140) were above the knee. Also, ""about 30% of injuries die before reaching hospital from bleeding or abdominal injuries. Most of the rest are amputees."" Out of 810 casualties that resulted in handicaps, 59.2% (480) were caused by land mines, whereas only 7.1% (58) were caused by bullets. 728 were men and 82 were women.  Locations March 1996  The total number of minefields demarcated between March 1993 and October 1995 is 121 or 1,880,868 msq. In 1996, Mine Advisory Group (MAG) will be investigating how demarcation and minefield survey can be more closely linked with the community education programme. This will enhance the impact of the mine awareness messages as well as providing a practical response until such time as clearance can begin. Demarcation teams will have to expand accordingly. (Source: MAG)  The borders with Kuwait, Iran, Syria and Turkey are severely mined.  Disaster Aid Center/UK reports that there are 2.5 million mines in the governate of Dohuk. Save the Children estimates the figure to be near the 5 million mark.  Minefields: Areas in Erbil Governate already clearly marked to indicate mines include Sardekan Hill, Azadi, Derband, Nawpradan, Konyarasukosa, Shik Mowlan/Kandinowberger, Sirmin/Sinan, and Kandibokidera.

96,26930,[4599],['Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding'],Chechen Town's Survivors Live Amid Ashes and Rubble of Russian Attacks,"By David Hoffman SAMASHKI, Russia -- In Moscow's brutal war against Chechen separatists, this is ground zero. The green metal fences are lacerated with bullet and shrapnel holes. Many rooftops are nothing more than skeletons. In the main market, women peddling vegetables keep a Russian artillery shell casing perched on the street in front of their stalls. Children climb recklessly on the glass-splattered, bombed-out building once known in the Soviet era as the House of Culture but now just a testament to the ruins of war. While other villages and towns have also been devastated in the 20-month-old Chechen conflict, few have surpassed the suffering of Samashki, a town of 12,000 people about 30 miles west of Grozny, the capital. It was here in April 1995 that drunken Russian soldiers went on a rampage, throwing grenades into cellars filled with women and children, killing more than 100 civilians. The killings prompted many protests by Russians opposed to the war, with some comparing it to the massacre by U.S. troops of Vietnamese civilians at My Lai. But it was not the end of Samashki's troubles. This year, in March, the town was hit again. According to residents, they had been given an ultimatum by Russian troops to cough up money and guns. But after they turned over three carloads of weapons, the Russians gave residents an abrupt warning to flee, then attacked the town again, in some cases leveling homes only recently rebuilt from the first assault. It was part of a larger, fierce offensive against Chechen separatist rebels that was launched just before President Boris Yeltsin announced a peace initiative on March 31. ""We don't plan to rebuild until the Russian army leaves,"" said Arbiyya Shansayev, 35, an agronomist, whose brother was slain in the first massacre. ""Right now, we're just living a life of subsistence."" Even taking into account the relatively primitive state of rural communities in Russia's outlying regions, Samashki is barely surviving. Once there was electricity, water and natural gas here. Now there is little of anything. Mounds of rubble, broken glass and bricks line the streets. A donkey-drawn cart brings water by the pail. A hammer echoes in the distance as one family struggles to make a house habitable again. ""You have to build some huts, at least,"" Shansayev said. As many as 15 people live in each of the houses still standing. But many of those who escaped last year's massacre have not escaped the destitution and despair that befall civilians caught in the throes of war. Asat Salgireva, 52, survived both attacks but lives amid the ashes of two homes -- both on the same site, both destroyed by Russian artillery shells. Now she occupies a tent along with six grandchildren, a son, two daughters and three elderly family members. Pots and pans lie on the dirt floor, and a jury-rigged pipe occasionally emits enough natural gas to cook a hot meal. Family members sell tomatoes and canned goods at the bazaar, hoping to earn the equivalent of 50 cents a day to survive. ""I don't know how we'll manage in the winter,"" she said. ""We'll have to ask people to take us in."" Behind the tent is a small truck garden, but she said they are afraid to eat the vegetables, fearing they have been somehow contaminated by the Russian bombardments. The front of the tent is a wasteland of ash and the remnants of her second house. A naked stovepipe protrudes into the air; a bathtub sits by a radiator. But the house, a prefabricated one brought to the town after the first attack, was demolished in the second. Mayerbeck Musayev, 52, who was born in Kazakhstan when Chechens were living there in exile by order of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, was sitting on a nearly crushed building across the street from his wrecked home. He had put a corrugated metal roof on it ""in order to survive the winter,"" he said. ""But until the [Russian troops] leave, nothing else will be done."" ""We are now eating our last grains of salt,"" he said, as young children raced toward the water cart with empty pails. The trials of Samashki offer an illustration of how civilians have been drawn into the vortex of this war between the light-footed Chechen rebels and the clumsy but heavily armed Russians. Chechen towns and villages are home for many of the guerrillas, and their lives are woven into those of civilians. The Russian forces, mostly Internal Affairs Ministry troops, are on unfamiliar, hostile territory. In fighting the rebels, the Russians have killed civilians by the thousands; more than 30,000 people have died here, most of them civilians caught in Russian onslaughts. The Samashki massacre occurred while Russian troops were purportedly searching for a few elusive guerrillas. After the killings, Russian authorities classified all the dead as ""fighters,"" but they were not. The massacre was later exhaustively documented in a report prepared by the Memorial Human Rights Center in Moscow. In interviews with witnesses, rights center investigators confirmed that the killings took place on April 7-8, 1995, after Russian troops had clashed with a small group of Chechen rebels near the village. Following the skirmish, the report said, Internal Affairs troops and riot police ""began an operation to mop up the village,"" described as ""an intense search of the streets, house-by-house, to find, neutralize or detain rebel fighters in hiding and also to seize arms caches."" But the victims of this ""mop-up"" operation were almost entirely civilians, according to the Moscow center, which documented the deaths of 103 people in what it said was an incomplete tally. According to the report, the villagers were killed by ""shelling, strafing of streets from armored vehicles, sniper fire on streets and in courtyards, execution-style shootings in houses and yards; grenades thrown into and exploded in cellars, yards and rooms with people present; the burning of houses, murders committed while detained people were being marched off."" Moreover, the report found, many of wounded villagers died because the troops refused to allow ""timely, decent medical help"" to reach them. Shakhid Adulyev, 64, a Samashki pensioner who survived the massacre, recalled that the Russian devastation of Grozny ""was bad, but this is worse.

(Source: HEWS)  12 Dec. 95 - Responding to criticism that the UN peacekeeping operation in Angola was stalled, the Secretary-General remarked: ""Many of the factors that prevented implementation of the earlier peace accords are still very much in evidence - distrust, continuing military activities, foot-dragging over quartering and related activities, obstruction of free movement and the restoration of government administration, lack of respect for the UN and other international personnel."" The UN has been unable to start its preliminary mine clearance operations, which must proceed before its forces can be fully deployed.  Overview SITUATION  Dec 95 - ""The whole of Angola must be considered a mined area."" That comment, made by a South African brigadier, sums up the dismal land mine situation in Angola. For three decades land mines have been used to devastating effect by a wide array of groups. ""The scope and complexity of the mine threat is probably greater than in any other country and will require a well-coordinated approach,"" notes the Executive Summary of the UN Mine Action Programme for Angola.  Roads, waterways, railroads, airports, ports, towns and private dwellings were mined in a scorched earth conflict that meant to deny the enemy land and resources that could not be held by army personnel. Bridges were mined to prevent saboteurs from attacking them; they were mined again after destruction to prevent repair work. Soldiers in retreat on both sides during the 1992 strife are reported to have mined schools, hospitals and markets.  Food supplies have been seriously affected by mines. People trapped in beseiged cities were forced to venture into mine infested areas to get to food. The 200,000 strong town of Luena, ringed by defensive minefields, is almost completely dependent on WFP food aid because the minefields have reduced the amount of land available for sustainable agriculture.  Repatriation of some 250,000 refugees from abroad, and resettlement of one million displaced persons inside Angola, is an essential part of the peace process. But the 9-15 million land mines threaten to derail peaceful repatriation and will ensure that Angola remains an economic basketcase for years to come. The mine menace poses an immediate threat to the in-coming UNAVEM III peace-keepers, mandated to hold the peace and begin a massive national reconstruction effort. The re-establishment of regional governments, and plans to hold elections may be dependent on mine clearance.  Casualties The UN estimates that 1.5% of the population has been injured in mine or UXO incidents. An ICRC survey in 1990 determined that 69% of the injured were walking on paths at the time of the blast, 15% on roads, and 16% in inhabitated areas. Angola has the highest number of amputees in the world, estimated at 70,000 in the UN's 1995 Angola Appeal. The ICRC has a rehabilitation center in Bomba Alto, where 11 staff manufacture prosthesis. Between Jan-Nov. 90, 631 new patients were fitted with prosthesis at the center, and a total of 1,127 prostheses were manufactured there for the year.

Background The end of the Cold War did not restore peace or order to this mineral rich country located in south-west Africa. Angola is 1,246,700 sq kms in area, bordered by Namibia, Zaire, Zambia and Congo. The capital city is Luanda. There are 18 provinces. The estimated population of 12,178,000 is matched by the presence of an estimated 9-15 million landmines.  The sowing of mines began in the 1960s when Portugal bitterly resisted anti-colonial movements, of which the most important were MPLA (Popular Front for the Liberation of Angola), led by Jose Eduardo Santos, and UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), led by Jonas Savimbi. The end of Portugese rule in 1975 was followed by economic collapse, civil war and military intervention by the super-powers and regional neighbors, all with an eye on Angola's extensive oil and mineral reserves.  ""While Portugese, Cuban and South African forces are known to have deployed landmines during operations in Angola, the overwhelming responsibility for landmines use lies with UNITA and the Angolan Army (FAPLA),"" report authors Roberts and Williams in After the Guns Fall Silent: The Enduring Legacy of Landmines.  Africa Watch reports that mines were an integral part of UNITA's hit-and-run war strategy: ""At one time or another, almost every part of the country was affected, as the foci of battle rapidly shifted backwards and forwards. Because of this mobility, the disruption of land communications was a major aim of UNITA, and the mining of roads, paths and bridges was consequently an important strategy."" The rebels also preferred to deploy anti-handling devices, and laid mines at random, unmarked.  In Lisbon, on 31 May 91, peace accords were signed between the MPLA and UNITA leaders as famine stalked the countryside. National elections were held under UN supervision between 29-30 Sep. 92. UNITA refused to concede defeat to the MPLA. The peace process was scuttled and war resumed.  Over the next two years, much of Angola was ruined. Over 3 million people were left dependent on food aid or humanitarian assistance. In Mar. 93 the Security Council authorized the creation of the Humanitarian Assistance Cooperation Unit (UCAH) to coordinate aid relief. On 20 Nov. 94 the Lusaka Protocol was signed, allowing for a ceasefire. UNITA accepted the election results and the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNIVEM III) began one of the most ambitious humanitarian intervention operations in history.  Mine notes Relief workers estimate there to be 34 types of landmines in Angola. There are many Russian-made mines, including the TMN-46, PMD-7-TS, M-19, PP-MI-SP, and the POMZ-2 anti-personnel mine. Activated by a tripwire, the POMZ-2 is stake mounted; rotting stakes pose a special hazard for deminers. The American M-18A1 mine has been found in Angola; with a kill radius of 50 meters, it releases 700 steel balls to cause maximum damage. The TMA-3, made in Yugoslavia, is an anti-tank mine that is non-detectable with hand-held metallic detectors (there is no metallic content in the mine fuse or body).

98,27346,[49458],['Camp Coordination and Camp Management'],Azerbaijan Situation Report 19 Aug-01 Oct 1996,"HIGHLIGHTS Joint UNDHA/UNHCR high-level mission arrives in Azerbaijan for discussions on Humanitarian Issues  DHA visits Fizuli region and in particular, the town of Horadiz, the location the Government of Azerbaijan has selected for the UNDP/WB reconstruction project. New UNDHA Humanitarian Affairs Officer and UNHCR Head of Liaison Office arrive in Baku. Contributions to DHA's Humanitarian Appeal (1995/96) for Azerbaijan are only 31.2 percent of the requirements. 1. Joint High-Level Mission of UNHCR/DHA: UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner, Mr. Sergio De Mello, Mr. John Horekens, UNHCR Bureau Chief for Europe and CIS, and Mr. Rashid Khalikov, Chief of Europe and Latin American Sections in UHDHA- CED New York arrived in Azerbaijan on 9 September for discussions with President Aliyev. The mission pledged to continue humanitarian support for the displaced and refugee population and proposed humanitarian assistance in the agorno-Karabakh within the framework of the OSCE Minsk Group. The mission also visited the IDP camp in Barda to see first hand the situation in the ex-Turkish camp. A copy of the DHA mission report is available at UNDHA Office in Baku. 2. DHA accompanies UNHCR Senior Desk Officer for Europe, Mr. Fernando Protti- Alvarado, on a field trip to the Fizuli region. The purpose of the visit was to observe UNHCR funded rehabilitation projects in the region as well as to map out a strategy plan for future UNHCR assistance in the area. The team visited the town of Horadiz, which the Government has selected for reconstruction activities. DHA will participate in discussions on inter-agency cooperation and strategies concerning the WB/UNDP project in the Fizuli area. 3. The reporting period saw the arrival of Jim O'Neill as the new UNDHA Humanitarian Affairs Office in Baku as well as Ms. Ann Howarth-Wiles as the Head of UNHCR Liaison Office-Baku. OVERALL HUMANITARIAN SITUATION Uncertainty in regards to project funding for the various International and National Organisations continues to be the most pressing issue faced in the humanitarian sector. ECHO has revealed that they will shortly begin phasing out of emergency funding activities and by April 1997 could be ready to hand over the task of development project funding to TASCIS. Funding difficulties are especially pertinent in the shelter sector as winter rapidly approaches and only minimal winterization projects are presently being carried out. It is feared that the vulnerable population will once again suffer a long and difficult winter. The involved agencies, UNHCR, Relief International (RI), International Rescue Committee (IRC), CARE and Hayat are performing exceptionally well in their construction and rehabilitation programmes but more and timely funding will be required in order to adequately improve the situation. With the previously mentioned funding cutbacks, several International Agencies will be completing various projects at the end of October, and presently are unclear on their future presence in Azerbaijan. Much anticipation is being given to the recent USAID strategy team visit and the possible funding outcome of their assessments. The issue of the Ex-Turkish camps has also become a concern. The deteriorating state of tents as well as the overall camp management has resulted in a series of requests from the Government of Armenia (GoA) to all International Organisations for assistance. DHA made a site visit to these two camps on 24 September, and found them to be managing reasonably well, albeit, at a reduced level. CARE (Agcabedi) and World Vision(Barda) have assumed the responsibility of the food distribution and have begun a re-registration of the camp residents in order to try and eliminate well documented instances of fraud in the distribution of humanitarian assistance at both camps. Food distributions are scheduled to occur in early October. As far as the camps health situation, RI will send their mobile health clinic, on a bi- monthly basis to the camps. SECTORS FOOD AID Owing to the lack of resources, most agencies will be scaling down their food assistance programmes in the near future, while attempting to target their aid at more defined vulnerable groups. WFP has an adequate food supply, both in country and in the pipeline, to carry out their projects and those of their implementing partners until June 1997. WFP initiated a revised distribution method, adopted by the relevant agencies , which concentrates on ""food per person"" as opposed to the previous distribution of ""family parcels"". It is felt that by distributing in this manner, food aid will be more controlled and target beneficiaries will be better met as well as saving considerable amounts of food which may have wound up in the market. The GoA, has declared in a decree made in August, 1996 that use of the ration card, commonly referred to as form ""No. 9"", will no longer be accepted for receiving humanitarian assistance. This form was originally used as a replacement for those citizens who had lost their passports while fleeing the conflict areas. The government rightfully feels, that the misuse and duplication of this card has contributed to the negative international response to the needs of Azerbaijan, and is attempting to make the receiving of humanitarian assistance more controllable. In its place a ""new"" and improved form No. 9"" will be issued. The initial ""new forms"" were made with thin paper. WFP feels that forms printed on this paper could be easily duplicated and has offered to provide a thicker, cardboard-type paper for its printing. It has been decided that the cardboard forms would be used uniquely in food distribution, while the thin-paper forms would be used for obtaining other types of assistance. One of the major problems encountered with the form change is that clear and concise information concerning the usage has not yet been initiated by the Government and relayed to the outlying areas. WFP continues to emphasize the need for a country-wide registration of IDPs/refugees in order to support the computerization of these figures which has already begun in some regions. The IFRC has launched a programme that will provide food items to 7,000 patients in more than 80 hospitals in Azerbaijan. HEALTH Several agencies are beginning to become involved in the reproductive health field. Most initial activities will be small scale and at selected regions. They will be geared to both IDPs and general populations. Meetings have occurred with these agencies in order to share resources and discuss future programmes. A WHO consultant visited Azerbaijan in September to assist in the establishment of family planning and reproductive health programmes in Ganja and Sumgayit. The consultant conducted a workshop in these towns to familiarize gynecologists with modern methods of family planning. August saw a major restructuring in the Ministry of Health (MoH). There was a considerable reduction in MoH staff and several Departments were integrated, notably the SES and the Epidemiological Department merged to form one countrywide unit. The MoH stress that these moves are more related to economical reasons rather a major Health Reform. There is a plan for a further reduction, estimated at 30-40 percent in staff cuts and the closure of up to 70,000 hospital beds. While there are still no private medical institutions in Azerbaijan, the MoH has established a system of ""payment for services"" in the hospitals. Full implementation of these charges has not yet been finalized. Owing to timely intervention by IFRC and MSF-Holland, malaria cases have decreased. In August, 839 cases were reported, considerably lower than in June and July. The MoH reports that up to 10,000 cases, mostly in the IDP camps of Imishli, Bilasuvar, and Sabirabad have been registered this year. Outbreaks of Anthrax, an acute bacterial infection that occurs most frequently in herbivorous animals, have been reported in Azerbaijan. Sales of lamb were suspended in several regions, especially in Agcabedi and Imishli, the principle areas for sheep production. A campaign to vaccinate the most ""at risk"", was conducted by the MoH. These would include butchers, wool handlers, and others involved in this occupation. No cases of Polio have been registered this year in Azerbaijan, evidence of UNICEF's successful MECACAR campaign. In 1993 there were 69 cases, 16 in 1994, and 5 in 1995. UNICEF and the MoH will conduct a country wide diphtheria immunization campaign during the month of October. The target group of approximately 4.5 million, will include children and adults. The findings of a joint UNICEF/WHO investigation revealed an increase of chronic exhaustion in children and the elderly as well as a high level, (20 percent), of iodine deficiency. As a result, a two year project on the development of health and nutrition systems in Azerbaijan will began in September. ICRC will continue to operate its orthopaedic centre first opened in 1995. Despite an ongoing cease fire, the number of mine related incidents are rising in the front line areas. SHELTER/NON-FOOD The focus in the shelter sector continues to be on those families living in the most extreme conditions, i.e. rail wagons, tents and dugouts. In addition, the arrival of colder weather helps to illustrate the need for improvements and/or winterization of public buildings, although difficulties in project funding have suspended or downsized many projects. The UNHCR funded, single-dwelling limestone shelter construction project continues to operate, but often, due to funding problems, work is delayed. Despite the delays, August saw the completion of 92 dwellings with an additional 171 started, for a cumulative total of 256 completed dwellings. RI, the main implementing partner for UNHCR in limestone shelter construction, will be finishing in October, construction of 150 houses in Saatly for railway wagon IDPs. Hayat, a local NGO, has completed 40 limestone units in Saatly designated for families living in extremely difficult conditions in the dug-outs. IRC has negotiated contracts and procured materials for up to 800 mud brick shelters. They will build 50 of these for families in the worse conditions at the ex-Turkish camp in Agcabedi following agreements with the camps administer, the Executive Committee of Agcabedi. CARE is also on schedule with their mud-brick shelter programme, with 1,100 out of a target number of 1,200, dwellings nearing completion. Public Building Rehabilitation (PBR) is being carried out by several organisations throughout the country. These projects range from rehabilitation of water and sanitary systems in medical facilities and children institutions, repair of school buildings, construction of partitions in rail way wagons housing IDP families, and the traditional PBR work in large structures housing IDPs. The GoA, reluctant initially, to approve PBR projects in Baku or Sumgaiyt, have relaxed their position and have begun to back projects in these areas. INCOME GENERATION There is a growing interest among the agencies in Income Generation projects (IG). Projects as diverse as sheep raising, distribution of small business kits, women sewing collectives, small business loans/grants, and greenhouses or other small scale agriculture projects are only a few of the areas covered. There is a tendency by some agencies to try and incorporate with shelter programmes, an idea of ""community building"" via IG projects in their various settlements. One of the more notable IG projects has been the IFRC's IDP ""construction team"". After gaining experience with construction activities in the camps, several work crews have emerged and have obtained building contracts in UNHCR and ECHO shelter projects. Another successful IFRC project has been selling vegetables grown by IDPs to the Hyatt Regency Hotel. ICRC has received 900 hectares in the Fizuli area project designed to sow and subsequently harvest 800-1000 MTs of wheat. Of this total, 400 MTs will be returned to the ICRC for distribution to vulnerable in the near by front- line region. Next year they intend to also grow vegetables and potatoes. TACIS has opened an office in Sabirabad where NGOs and any individuals can obtain advice in the different ways of income generation. It is anticipated that one of the best ways to bridge the transition process of relief to development will be in the creation of more IG projects. In order to inform the population about the various projects and to provide an opportunity to see finished products, the GoA in collaboration with NGOs is to hold an exhibition sometime in mid- October. CONTACTS DHA made introductory visits to all of the UN Agencies and most of the International and National Agencies in September. In addition a visits was also made to the office of Mr. Izzat Rustamov, Deputy Prime Minister in charge of International Humanitarian Assistance. October will bring about additional and more detailed discussions with the organisations, both Baku and field based. CONTRIBUTIONS As of the end of September, the DHA office in Azerbaijan has been informed of contributions of US$ 8,343,841 representing 31.2 percent of the total requested, US$ 32,966,638, in the 1996/97 Consolidated Appeal. ANNEX: RECENT GENERAL DEVELOPMENTS HUMANITARIAN AID A visit from 5 US Congressmen in August stir emotions for increased US assistance in Azerbaijan in 1997. The Congressmen passed an appeal to members of the sub-committee on Foreign Operations in the support for the draft of legislation for the funding for humanitarian assistance to Azerbaijan by NGOs and private volunteer organisations for 1997. American Oil Company (AMOCO) and ""AMERICARES"" have provided medical supplies (Kidney dialysis equipment) to the Oilmans hospital in Baku. Previously the same two have provided assistance in immunization programmes (Nakhchivan) and medical supplies for children in camps. The Russian oil company, LUKoil, has established a philanthropic society within their organisation. It will provide assistance mainly, but not exclusively to Russian citizens residing in Azerbaijan. In addition, assistance will be provided to the Orthodox Church, Slav Family, and to the individual needy citizens. They have delivered stockings to an elderly home and plan on assisting war invalids in the future. The Ministry of Social Welfare has announced that there are 1,200,000 pensioners and 250,000 invalids in Azerbaijan. AGRICULTURE 60 hectares of sugar beet seed have been planted in 5 regions of Azerbaijan for the first time. It is estimated that next August harvest will yield 60 MTs, enough to cover the current need. Harvesting of sugar beet began in September. It is hoped that the yield will be 40,000 MTs. This will be the fifth harvest of sugar beets in Azerbaijan. The crop is growing at a steady rate from the initial season, in 1992 with a net harvest of 16.400 MTs. 128,100 MTs of cotton have been picked thus far in Azerbaijan. The state order is for 310,000 MTs. Many IDPS are involved in this harvest earning 300 manats per kilo. According to the Ministry of Bread Products, Azerbaijan has purchased 257,000 MTs of grain this year, with 179,000 MTs being wheat and 77,000 MTs of barley. This is an increase of 22,000 MTs over last year. The Ministry claims it requires a minimum of 1.1 million MTs of grain per year. Preparations for the autumn sowing is continuing, 635,000 hectares (520,000 for wheat and 115,000 of barley) will be planted. On 26 August, the price of bread and all bread products increased by 100 Manats. This follows a 20 percent increase in July. In 1996, each month has seen a rise in price. The projected mixed vegetable harvest this year is 150,000 MTs. This includes 45,000 MTs of tomatoes, 5,000 MTs of cabbage, and 3,650 MTs of onions. Thus far 56,000 MTs or 37 percent of the projection have been harvested. The Minister of Agriculture, stated that of the total areas of land in the Republic, 8,641,000 hectares, 3,864,000 (45 percent) hectares will remain in Government hands, while 2,866,000 (33 percent) hectares will be transferred to municipal property and the remaining 1,911,000 (22 percent) will be privatized. A list of 3.8 million people who will be eligible to receive these private lands has been compiled. The arid summer has affected the quantity and quality of nut production. Mostly grown in the northern regions, an area of 16,895 hectares is usually planted. Last years yield was 10,336 MTs and this years it was expected to be close to 11,700 MTs, but the Ministry of Agriculture (MoAG) predicts a sharp decrease in the yield owing to the arid summer. As of mid-September, 48,000 MTs of grapes have been harvested. This figure represents 32 percent of the planned yield. Azeri scientists have announced they have developed a new type of pomegranate. It is more resistant, has a larger yield capacity, and contains 6 percent more sugar content than ordinary ones. PRIVATIZATION A World Bank Mission visited Azerbaijan with the goal of speeding up their 20 million Dollar project of establishing five pilot farmer economies, by reorganising the collective and state farms of the Uchar, Barda, Lenkoran, Salyan, and Khachmas regions. 581 livestock farms and 211 sheep and goat farms have been privatized. A total of 84,000 heads of cattle and 286,000 sheep and goats are kept in these farms. According to the Minister of Agriculture, there are 2,016 livestock farms in Azerbaijan and the future plans are for only 25 to be maintained by the state for breeding purposes. There are 16 private educational institutions functioning in Azerbaijan. They includes 3 colleges, 13 Universities and Institutes of higher learning. ECONOMY September 1 exchange rates 1 US$= 4,240 AzM September 30 1 US$= 4,215 AzM On 1 October, state employees in the education, cultural, mass media, health, sport and social sectors will receive a 40 percent salary increase. As of 1 January, 1997, there will be an excise mark placed on all cigarettes and alcohol sold in Azerbaijan. In addition, sales of these items will require the payment of an excise tax. The estimated cost of the excise mark is 90 Manat (approximately 1.3 US cents). On 13 September, the Russian Government lifted the restrictions for rail traffic from Azerbaijan to the Russian Federation via Daghestan. The resolution (No. 94) issued in December, 1994 as a result of the conflict in Chechnya. Initially, only cargo traffic will be permitted, but talks in resuming passenger traffic are underway and are expected to be finalized in the near future. In addition, Azerbaijan has been offered to join the ""Bishkek Agreement"", which offers visa free crossing of borders by citizens of the CIS. Azerbaijan has 2,215 kilometers of rail, 30,000 wagons and 800 passenger carriages, along with a work force of over 50,000. The port of Baku is estimating an increase of cargo circulation in 1997 to reach 8 million MTs following a ""four sided agreement"" with Central Asia countries. Thus far this year, cargo traffic, 5232,000 MTs between Baku and Central Asia is 16 percent lower than last year. This has been attributed to the Chechyna conflict. Arrangements have been finalized for the first stage of container-truck traffic on the route, Poti-Tbilisi-Baku. Transcaucasian railways or ""TRACECA"", an EU funded project. The projects aims is to increase container traffic along the rail corridor with an aim to market this service to Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Set to begin in October, the initial trains will carry 20-30 container-trucks per week. Following the visit of President Nazarbayev of Kazakhastan, 19-20 September, a number of bilateral agreements were signed with Azerbaijan. These include: cooperation in the transport sector, oil and gas industries, sport and culture and various economic issues, as well as discussing issues involved in the sectoral division of the Caspian Sea. ENERGY It is estimated that within two years Azerbaijan should achieve self sufficiency with natural gas. Between 12-14 billion cubic meters of gas are required each year. In 1995, Azerbaijan produced 6.5 billion cm, but with the ongoing oil exploration as well as the growing interest in this resource. The Republic is estimated to have 214 billion cubic meters in both onshore and offshore locations. January-August, 1996 oil and gas extraction figures are as follows: Oil- 6,069,9000 MTs (offshore oil-5,032,300 MTs, onshore oil-1,037,600 MTs), Gas-4.233 billion cubic meters (offshore gas-4.072 billion cm, onshore gas-160,900 million cubic meters. These figures are slightly down from 1995 extraction figures for the same period. The state gas company, Azerigas, has put aside 200 million cm of gas for the winter months. The usual winter requirement for Azerbaijan are 500 million cm. Because of this shortage, the cities of Baku, Sumgait, Ganja and a few selected regions will be supplied with gas. The President of Azerbaijan has liquidated the State Fuel Committee (SFC), and has declared that all kerosene sale stations and auto filling stations would be handed over to the State Property Committee and will subsequently be privatized. The other remaining SFC enterprises would be handed to SOCAR (State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic). The President of the AIOC (Azerbaijan of International Operating Company) estimates the cost for repairing the existing pipelines crossing Georgia and Russia to be US$ 70 million while the construction costs for the western pipeline (through Georgia) would be US$ 275 million. MISCELLANEOUS Two major world airlines, KLM and British Airways, began service to Baku in September. KLM will fly Amsterdam-Baku-Teheran while BA flies direct London-Baku three times a week. September saw the arrival of new Ambassadors for Turkey and Israel and the opening of the Argentinian Embassy.

New UNDHA Humanitarian Affairs Officer and UNHCR Head of Liaison Office arrive in Baku. Contributions to DHA's Humanitarian Appeal (1995/96) for Azerbaijan are only 31.2 percent of the requirements. 1. Joint High-Level Mission of UNHCR/DHA: UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner, Mr. Sergio De Mello, Mr. John Horekens, UNHCR Bureau Chief for Europe and CIS, and Mr. Rashid Khalikov, Chief of Europe and Latin American Sections in UHDHA- CED New York arrived in Azerbaijan on 9 September for discussions with President Aliyev. The mission pledged to continue humanitarian support for the displaced and refugee population and proposed humanitarian assistance in the agorno-Karabakh within the framework of the OSCE Minsk Group. The mission also visited the IDP camp in Barda to see first hand the situation in the ex-Turkish camp. A copy of the DHA mission report is available at UNDHA Office in Baku. 2. DHA accompanies UNHCR Senior Desk Officer for Europe, Mr. Fernando Protti- Alvarado, on a field trip to the Fizuli region. The purpose of the visit was to observe UNHCR funded rehabilitation projects in the region as well as to map out a strategy plan for future UNHCR assistance in the area. The team visited the town of Horadiz, which the Government has selected for reconstruction activities. DHA will participate in discussions on inter-agency cooperation and strategies concerning the WB/UNDP project in the Fizuli area. 3. The reporting period saw the arrival of Jim O'Neill as the new UNDHA Humanitarian Affairs Office in Baku as well as Ms. Ann Howarth-Wiles as the Head of UNHCR Liaison Office-Baku. OVERALL HUMANITARIAN SITUATION Uncertainty in regards to project funding for the various International and National Organisations continues to be the most pressing issue faced in the humanitarian sector. ECHO has revealed that they will shortly begin phasing out of emergency funding activities and by April 1997 could be ready to hand over the task of development project funding to TASCIS. Funding difficulties are especially pertinent in the shelter sector as winter rapidly approaches and only minimal winterization projects are presently being carried out. It is feared that the vulnerable population will once again suffer a long and difficult winter. The involved agencies, UNHCR, Relief International (RI), International Rescue Committee (IRC), CARE and Hayat are performing exceptionally well in their construction and rehabilitation programmes but more and timely funding will be required in order to adequately improve the situation. With the previously mentioned funding cutbacks, several International Agencies will be completing various projects at the end of October, and presently are unclear on their future presence in Azerbaijan. Much anticipation is being given to the recent USAID strategy team visit and the possible funding outcome of their assessments. The issue of the Ex-Turkish camps has also become a concern. The deteriorating state of tents as well as the overall camp management has resulted in a series of requests from the Government of Armenia (GoA) to all International Organisations for assistance. DHA made a site visit to these two camps on 24 September, and found them to be managing reasonably well, albeit, at a reduced level. CARE (Agcabedi) and World Vision(Barda) have assumed the responsibility of the food distribution and have begun a re-registration of the camp residents in order to try and eliminate well documented instances of fraud in the distribution of humanitarian assistance at both camps. Food distributions are scheduled to occur in early October. As far as the camps health situation, RI will send their mobile health clinic, on a bi- monthly basis to the camps. SECTORS FOOD AID Owing to the lack of resources, most agencies will be scaling down their food assistance programmes in the near future, while attempting to target their aid at more defined vulnerable groups. WFP has an adequate food supply, both in country and in the pipeline, to carry out their projects and those of their implementing partners until June 1997. WFP initiated a revised distribution method, adopted by the relevant agencies , which concentrates on ""food per person"" as opposed to the previous distribution of ""family parcels"". It is felt that by distributing in this manner, food aid will be more controlled and target beneficiaries will be better met as well as saving considerable amounts of food which may have wound up in the market. The GoA, has declared in a decree made in August, 1996 that use of the ration card, commonly referred to as form ""No. 9"", will no longer be accepted for receiving humanitarian assistance. This form was originally used as a replacement for those citizens who had lost their passports while fleeing the conflict areas. The government rightfully feels, that the misuse and duplication of this card has contributed to the negative international response to the needs of Azerbaijan, and is attempting to make the receiving of humanitarian assistance more controllable. In its place a ""new"" and improved form No. 9"" will be issued. The initial ""new forms"" were made with thin paper. WFP feels that forms printed on this paper could be easily duplicated and has offered to provide a thicker, cardboard-type paper for its printing. It has been decided that the cardboard forms would be used uniquely in food distribution, while the thin-paper forms would be used for obtaining other types of assistance. One of the major problems encountered with the form change is that clear and concise information concerning the usage has not yet been initiated by the Government and relayed to the outlying areas. WFP continues to emphasize the need for a country-wide registration of IDPs/refugees in order to support the computerization of these figures which has already begun in some regions. The IFRC has launched a programme that will provide food items to 7,000 patients in more than 80 hospitals in Azerbaijan. HEALTH Several agencies are beginning to become involved in the reproductive health field. Most initial activities will be small scale and at selected regions. They will be geared to both IDPs and general populations. Meetings have occurred with these agencies in order to share resources and discuss future programmes. A WHO consultant visited Azerbaijan in September to assist in the establishment of family planning and reproductive health programmes in Ganja and Sumgayit. The consultant conducted a workshop in these towns to familiarize gynecologists with modern methods of family planning. August saw a major restructuring in the Ministry of Health (MoH). There was a considerable reduction in MoH staff and several Departments were integrated, notably the SES and the Epidemiological Department merged to form one countrywide unit. The MoH stress that these moves are more related to economical reasons rather a major Health Reform. There is a plan for a further reduction, estimated at 30-40 percent in staff cuts and the closure of up to 70,000 hospital beds. While there are still no private medical institutions in Azerbaijan, the MoH has established a system of ""payment for services"" in the hospitals. Full implementation of these charges has not yet been finalized. Owing to timely intervention by IFRC and MSF-Holland, malaria cases have decreased. In August, 839 cases were reported, considerably lower than in June and July. The MoH reports that up to 10,000 cases, mostly in the IDP camps of Imishli, Bilasuvar, and Sabirabad have been registered this year. Outbreaks of Anthrax, an acute bacterial infection that occurs most frequently in herbivorous animals, have been reported in Azerbaijan. Sales of lamb were suspended in several regions, especially in Agcabedi and Imishli, the principle areas for sheep production. A campaign to vaccinate the most ""at risk"", was conducted by the MoH. These would include butchers, wool handlers, and others involved in this occupation. No cases of Polio have been registered this year in Azerbaijan, evidence of UNICEF's successful MECACAR campaign. In 1993 there were 69 cases, 16 in 1994, and 5 in 1995. UNICEF and the MoH will conduct a country wide diphtheria immunization campaign during the month of October. The target group of approximately 4.5 million, will include children and adults. The findings of a joint UNICEF/WHO investigation revealed an increase of chronic exhaustion in children and the elderly as well as a high level, (20 percent), of iodine deficiency. As a result, a two year project on the development of health and nutrition systems in Azerbaijan will began in September. ICRC will continue to operate its orthopaedic centre first opened in 1995. Despite an ongoing cease fire, the number of mine related incidents are rising in the front line areas.

January-August, 1996 oil and gas extraction figures are as follows: Oil- 6,069,9000 MTs (offshore oil-5,032,300 MTs, onshore oil-1,037,600 MTs), Gas-4.233 billion cubic meters (offshore gas-4.072 billion cm, onshore gas-160,900 million cubic meters. These figures are slightly down from 1995 extraction figures for the same period. The state gas company, Azerigas, has put aside 200 million cm of gas for the winter months. The usual winter requirement for Azerbaijan are 500 million cm. Because of this shortage, the cities of Baku, Sumgait, Ganja and a few selected regions will be supplied with gas. The President of Azerbaijan has liquidated the State Fuel Committee (SFC), and has declared that all kerosene sale stations and auto filling stations would be handed over to the State Property Committee and will subsequently be privatized. The other remaining SFC enterprises would be handed to SOCAR (State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic). The President of the AIOC (Azerbaijan of International Operating Company) estimates the cost for repairing the existing pipelines crossing Georgia and Russia to be US$ 70 million while the construction costs for the western pipeline (through Georgia) would be US$ 275 million. MISCELLANEOUS Two major world airlines, KLM and British Airways, began service to Baku in September. KLM will fly Amsterdam-Baku-Teheran while BA flies direct London-Baku three times a week. September saw the arrival of new Ambassadors for Turkey and Israel and the opening of the Argentinian Embassy.

99,27552,[49458],['Camp Coordination and Camp Management'],Kenya: Somalia Refugees Situation Report No. 3,"emergency appeal no. 01.04/96 situation report no. 1 period covered: January - February 1996 Living conditions at the Red Cross camp for Somali refugees in Swaleh Nguru camp have deteriorated sharply due to an influx of over 5,000 unregistered refugees who fled there after the Kenyan governments closure of Marafa camp in December 1995. International Federation and Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) teams are battling to provide additional water, sanitation and health facilities for the new arrivals, while continuing to wait for UNHCR and the Kenyan government to decide whether these refugees can be officially registered at the camp. Red Cross services at the other camps at Jomvu and Hatimi continued to run smoothly in the first two months of 1996, but its support operations for the rest of the year are threatened by the negligible amount of funding received so far from international donors. The Federation appeals to donors to continue their assistance to Somali refugees in 1996 until all have been safely resettled elsewhere or finally returned home. The context The Federation/KRCS support operation for Somali refugees has been running since February 1992, soon after their initial arrival in Kenya. The support services include camp management, distribution of food and non-food items, preventive and curative health care and the provision of social services (education, mental health, physical therapy and vocational training). At the beginning of 1995 the Federation/KRCS shared responsibility for managing five camps holding 100,000 refugees on the Kenyan coast, but by the end of the year the number of camps had been reduced to three and the refugee population had fallen to 25,000. Latest events In 1995, more than 52,000 refugees living in Kenya finally left the country. Some 42,000 of these were Somalis returning home in UNHCR-organised road convoys, ships and air charters costing more than 166.5 million Kenyan Shillings (CHF 3.5 million). In addition, approximately 3,300 Ethiopian, 1,000 Ugandan and 240 Rwandan refugees opted to return home, while more than 6,000 refugees were resettled to third countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. After the closure of Marafa, between 500 and 600 refugees refused to leave the camp, so on 24 January Kenyan police forcibly removed the remaining occupants. Over 198 refugees were transported to Dabaad by UNHCR, while several hundred vanished, eventually finding their way to Swaleh Nguru and increasing the unregistered population in that camp to over 5,000. As a 20 March 1996 result of this influx, there has been a significant increase in security problems, a sharp deterioration of health and sanitation conditions inside and outside the camp due to over-crowding, and a lack of food. Red Cross staff have become increasingly concerned at the situation in Swaleh Nguru and so have asked UNHCR to convene a meeting with WFP and the Kenyan government to discuss these issues and establish a viable policy on the unregistered population. All remaining structures (other than permanent buildings) in Marafa were demolished by the Kenyan government and UNHCR reports that the local government continues to apply pressure to have all camps on the coast closed as soon as possible. This local resolve has stiffened recently due to the increased number of unregistered refugees moving into Swaleh Nguru. The Kenyan government announced a proposal that refugees not be allowed to enter Mombasa without a travel permit, and should a refugee be caught without such a permit, he or she would be arrested and deported. But to date, this proposal has not been implemented. However, the degree of anger and tension within the refugee community as a result of these pressures was tragically highlighted when three refugees (in separate incidents) set themselves on fire in protest over alleged mistreatment by UNHCR. Two of the refugees were Ethiopians and one of them died from his injuries. Red Cross/Red Crescent action Official Red Cross camp population figures for the first two months of the year were as follows:    Camp   January   February     Swaleh Nguru   9,934   9,950     Hatimi   3,340   3,333     Jomvu   5,266   5,266     Total   18,540   18,549    However, a Red Cross nutritional survey estimated that the real population of Swaleh Nguru is 15,500 at present the balance being unofficial refugees. Food and Non-Food Distributions In both January and February no WFP maize was available for distribution so a double ration of wheat flour (400g per person/per day) was given to the refugees. There was also a shortage of beans in February, which resulted in a reduction of the ration size from 50g to 25g per person/per day. According to WFP, stocks of vegetable oil are virtually depleted and some camps will face a shortage in the coming months (possibly as early as May). Due to the continued difficulties encountered by WFP in releasing stocks of sugar impounded at Kenyan ports, the next distribution of sugar is also likely to be the last. The amounts of food distributed to 18,549 refugees for the first two months of 1996 were as follows:    Food   January (mt)   February (mt)     Wheatflour   238.5   223.4     Pulses   27.8   12.8     Vegetable Oil   13.9   13.9     Salt   2.78   2.74     Total   282.98   252.87    In January, the International Islamic Relief Organisation distributed rice, flour, vegetable oil, dates and sugar to the refugees of Swaleh Nguru camp (though outside the camp perimeters and in contravention of the policy established by the Ministry of Home Affairs and National Heritage that all donations of food aid which has been granted duty-free import must be distributed as part of the established food distribution and ration system). One hundred bags (90 kg each) of charcoal were distributed to 100 families in Swaleh Nguru by Red Cross teams, while plastic sheeting, mosquito nets, soap and used clothing (two bales per camp) were also handed out to the most vulnerable in Hatimi and Swaleh Nguru. Logistics Two new field vehicles donated by the German Red Cross have arrived and are awaiting clearance by the Operational Support Unit (OSU) in Nairobi. These vehicles will replace two others which will be rotated out of the fleet because they are no longer cost effective to run. With the scaling down of the Somali refugee support operation, a needs analysis has just been completed and several vehicles identified for release to the National Society (as per an earlier agreement) and to the OSU for other operations within the region. Medical The number of malaria cases and deaths have increased in Swaleh Nguru camp since late December 1995, prompting the Red Cross medical department to begin health education campaigns covering oral medication, environmental hygiene, malaria prevention and the importance of seeking health care at the onset of an illness. This was followed by meetings with elders, private health practitioners and the womens committee to solicit their support for educating the communities on the importance of following Red Cross guidelines on malaria treatment. In January, 1,257 cases of malaria were treated (13 deaths were reported), which fell sharply in February to 967 cases and 10 deaths. The number of patients seen in the Red Cross camp clinics at Utange and Jomvu are as follows:       January   February     OPD   4,778   2,821     Admissions   392   584     Referrals   218   216     TB cases   89   94     Total   5,477   3,715    The presence of thousands of unofficial refugees has imposed severe strains on Red Cross budgets for drugs, medical supplies, water, sanitation and social services. The sometimes fierce demands for assistance have also occasionally erupted into physical assaults on humanitarian workers, in turn resulting in upgraded security procedures in the camp. Meanwhile, a house-to-house nutritional survey in Swaleh Nguru in February revealed a fall in the nutritional status of children under five years (with an overall malnutrition rate of 7.9% compared to 5.1% in Swaleh Nguru in January 1995 and 6% in Marafa in June 1995). The survey estimated that of the 890 children under five in the camp, 61 were less than 80% weight for height and ten were severely malnourished, being less than 70%weight for height. The survey recommended that a therapeutic feeding programme be started for severely-malnourished children and a buffer stock of food items made available to the Red Cross health and social services departments to give to familie at risk. This deterioration appears to be entirely due to the influx of refugees from Marafa, because nutritional levels amongst children in Jomvu and Hatimi has improved since last October (with only 11 and six children respectively still requiring nutritional care). In January, another study identified a desperate need for social and medical rehabilitation services in Jomvu camp. The report (with budget projections) has been forwarded to UNHCRs medical and social services co-ordinators for consideration. The following month, a separate report focusing on improvements to the existing provision of care for HIV/AIDS patients concluded that all HIV positive cases should be relocated to Kakuma and that those people in the advanced stages of the infection should be given shelter, special food, as well as supplementary feeding from an agency still to be identified. Water, Sanitation and Construction Water supplies to all camps were adequate and of safe quality. The commercial trucking in Jomvu camp was reduced following the re-deployment of a Red Cross water tanker after the completion of maintenance and repairs which makes two journeys per day from Swaleh Nguru to Jomvu (carrying 28,000 litres in total). In Hatimi, well operations were also restored. Sanitation conditions in Swaleh Nguru camp continue to deteriorate due to the impact of unregistered refugees from Marafa camp and Nairobi district. To try to improve these conditions, seven sites have been fenced in to keep garbage from spreading, construction of a 28-person toilet block is underway and improvements are being made to the drainage capacity of the existing toilet systems. To assist in these modifications, three more sanitation workers were hired by the Federation/KRCS. In Jomvu, all the toilet blocks have been renovated and UNHCR is planning to construct an additional 20 shelters for ex-Marafa refugees, which will partly alleviate the acute housing problem for new residents. Social Services At the beginning of the year, the Red Cross social services department began to merge its services within the medical and relief sectors of the programme. So far, this merger has been running smoothly. While schools re-opened on 8 January, there were low levels of enrolment in the first two months, though this is expected to pick up in March with the end of Ramadan and the launching of a campaign to encourage children to go to school. Due to the fear and anxiety caused by the ongoing uncertainty about their future in Kenya, the number of refugees seeking counselling by Red Cross staff and volunteers remains high. A special committee was also formed to help address the problems and meet the needs of the handicapped inhabitants of the camps. The Hatimi Community Centre was formally inaugurated in January and two bales of clothing distributed to vulnerable people. KRCS staff also organised the first Womens Conference where Social Issues of Concern to Women were discussed in five workshops in Hatimi and Swaleh Nguru camps between 28 February and 8 March.

These areas cover general management skills; stress management and conflict resolution; resume writing and interview skills; time-management; and drivers training. Courses will be held to build and strengthen staff skills in their current positions, while at the same time preparing them for the new job market pending the closure of the camps. The existing staff structure at the beginning of 1996 was as follows:       January   February     Federation Delegates   5   5     Federation Local Staff   2   2     KRCS Staff (Contract)   61   61     KRCS Staff (Temporary)   70   73     GOK Staff (MoH)   14   13     Refugee Volunteers   296   279     Total   443   428    Outstanding needs The issue of unregistered refugees in Swaleh Nguru camp must be addressed by the Kenyan government and UNHCR soon. This group of refugees should either be relocated to Dabaad camps in north-eastern Kenya; or officially registered and receive appropriate shelter and ration cards. If this is not decided quickly, the health and security of both refugees and humanitarian staff will be threatened. Funding or in-kind donations of soap and charcoal (or another cooking fuel) needs to be identified urgently because UNHCR which normally supplies these needs does not have funding for the project this year.
