62,23385,[4596],HIV/Aids,Epidemic of Inequality: Women's Rights and HIV/AIDS in Botswana & Swaziland,"Introduction  Deeply entrenched gender inequities perpetuate the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Botswana and Swaziland, the two countries with the highest HIV prevalence in the world.10 The legal systems in both countries grant women lesser status than men, restricting property, inheritance and other rights. Social, economic and cultural practices create, enforce and perpetuate legalized gender inequalities and discrimination in all aspects of women's lives. Neither country has met its obligations under international human rights law. As a result, women continue to be disproportionately vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. This is most starkly demonstrated by the association of gender discriminatory beliefs and sexual risk-taking documented in this report. In Botswana, participants who held three or more gender discriminatory beliefs had 2.7 times the odds of having unprotected sex in the past year with a non-primary partner as those who held fewer beliefs. In Swaziland, those surveyed who held 6 or more discriminatory attitudes had twice the odds of having multiple sexual partners than those who held less than 6.  In both Botswana and Swaziland, a substantial percentage of PHR community survey participants who had been tested for HIV reported that they could not refuse the test. The continuing extraordinary prevalence of HIV in Botswana, particularly among women, demonstrates that campaigns, scaled-up HIV testing, including routine testing, and anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment are not enough. Women must be empowered with legal rights, sufficient food and economic opportunities to gain agency of their own lives. Men must be educated and supported to acknowledge women's equal status and throw off the yoke of socially- and culturally-sanctioned discriminatory beliefs and risky sexual behavior. HIV/AIDS interventions focused solely on individual behavior will not address the factors creating vulnerability to HIV for women and men in Botswana and Swaziland, nor protect the rights and assure the wellbeing of those living with HIV/AIDS. National leaders, with the assistance of foreign donors and others, are obligated under international law to take immediate steps to change the unequal social, legal and economic conditions of women's lives which facilitate HIV transmission and impede testing, care and treatment. Without these immediate and comprehensive reforms, they cannot hope to halt the deadly toll of HIV/AIDS on their populations.","Epidemic of Inequality: Women's Rights and HIV/AIDS in Botswana & Swaziland Introduction  Deeply entrenched gender inequities perpetuate the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Botswana and Swaziland, the two countries with the highest HIV prevalence in the world.10 The legal systems in both countries grant women lesser status than men, restricting property, inheritance and other rights.

The Principles and Protocols of Humanitarian Operation (PPHO) was developed in late 1995 and included UN and NGO agencies. The Joint Policy of Operation (JPO) was developed in response to the massive looting of relief resources in Monrovia in April 1996, and underwent several revisions as the situation changed. Unlike the PPHO, it was developed by and restricted to NGOs only.  Both the PPHO and the JPO have received considerable publicity and have won the attention of policy-makers, field staff and researchers alike. At the policy-level, their example has spawned other similar mechanisms, such as the ""Principles of Engagement and Disengagement"" currently being developed in Eastern Congo. At the field level many aid workers have carried their experiences from Liberia into other situations, for example in Sierra Leone. The PPHO and JPO have also received attention from the research community, with the OCHA report on Strategic Coordination in the Great Lakes, for instance, recommending that OCHA ""build on NGO experience in Liberia with codes of conduct (Lautze et al. 1998: 101). This case study is an attempt to develop an independent understanding of the two mechanisms and the impact they have had on the humanitarian situation in Liberia, and forms part of a wider study of humanitarian principles.","The ""Joint Policy of Operation"" and the ""Principles and Protocols of Humanitarian Operation"" in Liberia Confronted with some of the most serious challenges ever faced in the provision of relief aid in conflict, the humanitarian community in Liberia developed two inter-agency mechanisms intended to reduce the extent to which their assistance was manipulated, and to increase respect for the principles of International Humanitarian Law (IHL).

It describes the successes and challenges of the policy and programme interventions developed across the affected areas of NWFP and AJK.

Globally, the number of armed conflicts has been decreasing since 1995, when it peaked at 44 recorded civil wars. By 2003, seven of these conflicts had ended, and in 2003 there were 37 active conflicts in the world. More than 80 percent of these conflicts were in Asia and Africa.

These evaluations typically measure not only direct casualties due to violence but often indirect casualties among persons affected by the breakdown of the health and social-service infrastructure and its consequences.  A World Health Organization report underlined the use of mortality and nutrition as indicators for assessing the severity of a complex emergency; for identifying needs, prioritizing interventions, and monitoring impacts; and for advocacy purposes. While these factors serve as broad indications of the severity and nature of a conflict, an understanding of the process and therefore planning of the response depends on many external variables and constraints that are unique to each emergency situation.","Civil Conflicts in Four African Countries: A Five-Year Review of Trends in Nutrition and Mortality Armed conflicts are defined as political conflicts in which armed combat involves the armed forces of at least one state or one or more armed factions seeking to gain control of all or part of the state, and in which at least 1,000 people have been killed by the fighting during the course of the conflict.

73,24149,[4600],Protection and Human Rights,Securing Pakistan's Tribal Belt,"Pakistan constitutes one of the most important and difficult challenges facing U.S. foreign policy. What is at stake is considerable by any measure. Pakistan is the world's second-most populous Muslim-majority country, with nearly 170 million people. It shares borders with Afghanistan, where U.S. and allied forces are struggling to promote stability amid a continuing insurgency, and India, with which it has fought a series of conflicts. Pakistan's nuclear arsenal and history of abetting proliferation put it in a position to dilute global efforts to stem the spread of nuclear materials and weapons. And it is host to local extremist groups, the Taliban, and global terrorist organizations, most notably al-Qaeda. The relationship between the United States and Pakistan has long been characterized by cooperation and recrimination alike. Pakistan is a strategic friend of the United States, but one that often appears unable or unwilling to address a number of vexing security concerns. Political disarray has further hampered Islamabad's capacity for strong and united action. The result in Washington is often frustration mixed with uncertainty about what to do about it.","Securing Pakistan's Tribal Belt Pakistan constitutes one of the most important and difficult challenges facing U.S. foreign policy.

And it is host to local extremist groups, the Taliban, and global terrorist organizations, most notably al-Qaeda. The relationship between the United States and Pakistan has long been characterized by cooperation and recrimination alike. Pakistan is a strategic friend of the United States, but one that often appears unable or unwilling to address a number of vexing security concerns.

79,25716,[12033],Mine Action,DHA Demining Programme Report,"Angola Country Report Structure SITUATION - Under the Unit for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Angola (UCAH), the Central Mine Action Office (CMAO), in cooperation with the United Nations Verification Mission to Angola (UNAVEM III), is developing a comprehensive mine action plan, established with funds raised through a Consolidated Appeal. CMAO is modeled on similar UN-established indigenous mine clearance operations in Mozambique, Afghanistan and Cambodia. Under the terms of the Lusaka Protocol, the warring parties (UNITA/FAA) are responsible for mine clearance. UNAVEM III is mandated to stay in Angola until Feb. 97.  Accomplishments SITUATION - United Nations mine clearance operations in Angola are set to begin in early Mar. 96. Internal UN budgeting and deployment delays, combined political instability, and a shaky cease-fire on the ground, led to lengthy delays. The UNAVEM III operation is budgeted for 1,080 deminers. NGOs have established programmes working under contract to donors.  Mine Awareness: The INAROE Mine Awareness Programme has graduated 59 students, bringing the aggregate total to 106 graduates.  Mine Clearance: Should start early Mar. 96.  Mine Training: Set to start 22 Jan. 96.  Mine Survey: See NPA data. Deployment and Roads: The Mechem contract has been officially approved by the Angolan government and was due to start in Dec. 95.  GOALS FOR 1995 - Priority actions for CMAO during 1995 included:  1) Create the Instituto Nacional de Accao sobre as Minas - INAM (National Mine Action Institute) so the Government of Angola can ultimately assume responsibility for mine clearance.  2) Mine experts will be hired to supervise Government and UNITA engineers in verifying, surveying and, where essential, clearing mines.  3) Expand mine awareness education to cover all repatriation camps and internally displace populations, UN and NGO personnel, and affected Angolan communities.  4) Survey all provinces for mines and establish a national land mine database for urban areas in mine-infested cities.  5) Establish the Central Mine Action Training School in Luanda. Smaller schools, already established in Kuito, Luena, and Malange, will be afffiliated with the Luanda school to ensure standard operating procedures.  6) Verify and clear mines. Establish priorities for verification and clearance using a special priority rating system for exceptional clearance requests.  7) Establish regional mine action offices in each of the six UNAVEM headquarters. These offices will coordinate all UN and NGO mine action projects.

MAG reports that it chose Luena province because of the town's severe mine problem, which includes defensive mined rings that have been remined over the years.  Accomplishments: (Jan. 96) Demining: Since the first demining team became operational a total of 85,610 msq has been cleared of 5 mines and 93 UXO. Average monthly clearance is 24,000 msq. The Luena minefields are relatively low density and overgrown with vegetation.  Mine Awareness: A community mine awareness programme (CMAP) is in place  Norwegian People's Aid (NPA) Purpose: (Dec. 95) NPA arrived in-country in Sep. 94.

The UN has been unable to start its preliminary mine clearance operations, which must proceed before its forces can be fully deployed.  OVERVIEW SITUATION  9 Feb 96 - Despite a 15-month cease-fire and several UN arms embargoes, Angola's government and UNITA rebels continue to receive weapons that fuel a continuing low-level war, Human Rights Watch says in a new report. These new weapon shipments are seen as undermining the demobilization and demilitarization efforts which as the core of the peace process.  Human Rights Watch indicates that finding weapons backer is difficult since ""some of the shipments to UNITA have gone through surreptitious routes"". This has been exacerbated by the maintenance of mercenaries by both sides. One South African-based frim . Executive Outcomes (EO) has been employed by both sides to provide security and training. Although Angolan President Dos Santos has stated that EO's contract has been cancelled and all its personnel are out of the country, Human Rights Watch argues that the firm might be using several front companies to carry out contracts. The new report names Saracen International, Stuart Mills International and Shibata Security as suspected EO front companies helping in mine clearance. (Source: First!)  8 Feb 96 - The Security Council, by resolution 1045, renewed UNAVEM III's mandate for three months. The resolution expressed deep concern at ""the numerous delays in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol"". The Security Council urged the government and UNITA to maintain an effective cease-fire, conclude military talks on integrating the armed forces and actively undertake mine clearing. The UN states that joint demining, opening of raods and the free circulation of people throughout the country is imperative for national reconciliation. (Source: DPKO)  6 Feb 96 - Brian Atwood, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has sent a letter to UNITA leader Savimbi suggesting that both UNITA and the government begin to eliminate their stockpiles of landmines. (Source: HEWS)  Dec 95 - ""The whole of Angola must be considered a mined area."" That comment, made by a South African brigadier, sums up the dismal land mine situation in Angola. For three decades land mines have been used to devastating effect by a wide array of groups. ""The scope and complexity of the mine threat is probably greater than in any other country and will require a well-coordinated approach,"" notes the Executive Summary of the UN Mine Action Programme for Angola.  Roads, waterways, railroads, airports, ports, towns and private dwellings were mined in a scorched earth conflict that meant to deny the enemy land and resources that could not be held by army personnel. Bridges were mined to prevent saboteurs from attacking them; they were mined again after destruction to prevent repair work. Soldiers in retreat on both sides during the 1992 strife are reported to have mined schools, hospitals and markets.  Food supplies have been seriously affected by mines. People trapped in beseiged cities were forced to venture into mine infested areas to get to food. The 200,000 strong town of Luena, ringed by defensive minefields, is almost completely dependent on WFP food aid because the minefields have reduced the amount of land available for sustainable agriculture.  Repatriation of some 250,000 refugees from abroad, and resettlement of one million displaced persons inside Angola, is an essential part of the peace process. But the 9-15 million land mines threaten to derail peaceful repatriation and will ensure that Angola remains an economic basketcase for years to come. The mine menace poses an immediate threat to the in-coming UNAVEM III peace-keepers, mandated to hold the peace and begin a massive national reconstruction effort. The re-establishment of regional governments, and plans to hold elections may be dependent on mine clearance.  Casualties The UN estimates that 1.5% of the population has been injured in mine or UXO incidents. An ICRC survey in 1990 determined that 69% of the injured were walking on paths at the time of the blast, 15% on roads, and 16% in inhabitated areas. Angola has the highest number of amputees in the world, estimated at 70,000 in the UN's 1995 Angola Appeal. The ICRC has a rehabilitation center in Bomba Alto, where 11 staff manufacture prosthesis. Between Jan-Nov. 90, 631 new patients were fitted with prosthesis at the center, and a total of 1,127 prostheses were manufactured there for the year.

Background The end of the Cold War did not restore peace or order to this mineral rich country located in south-west Africa. Angola is 1,246,700 sq kms in area, bordered by Namibia, Zaire, Zambia and Congo. The capital city is Luanda. There are 18 provinces. The estimated population of 12,178,000 is matched by the presence of an estimated 9-15 million landmines.  The sowing of mines began in the 1960s when Portugal bitterly resisted anti-colonial movements, of which the most important were MPLA (Popular Front for the Liberation of Angola), led by Jose Eduardo Santos, and UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), led by Jonas Savimbi. The end of Portugese rule in 1975 was followed by economic collapse, civil war and military intervention by the super-powers and regional neighbors, all with an eye on Angola's extensive oil and mineral reserves.  ""While Portugese, Cuban and South African forces are known to have deployed landmines during operations in Angola, the overwhelming responsibility for landmines use lies with UNITA and the Angolan Army (FAPLA),"" report authors Roberts and Williams in After the Guns Fall Silent: The Enduring Legacy of Landmines.  Africa Watch reports that mines were an integral part of UNITA's hit-and-run war strategy: ""At one time or another, almost every part of the country was affected, as the foci of battle rapidly shifted backwards and forwards. Because of this mobility, the disruption of land communications was a major aim of UNITA, and the mining of roads, paths and bridges was consequently an important strategy."" The rebels also preferred to deploy anti-handling devices, and laid mines at random, unmarked.  In Lisbon, on 31 May 91, peace accords were signed between the MPLA and UNITA leaders as famine stalked the countryside. National elections were held under UN supervision between 29-30 Sep. 92. UNITA refused to concede defeat to the MPLA. The peace process was scuttled and war resumed.  Over the next two years, much of Angola was ruined. Over 3 million people were left dependent on food aid or humanitarian assistance. In Mar. 93 the Security Council authorized the creation of the Humanitarian Assistance Cooperation Unit (UCAH) to coordinate aid relief. On 20 Nov. 94 the Lusaka Protocol was signed, allowing for a ceasefire. UNITA accepted the election results and the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNIVEM III) began one of the most ambitious humanitarian intervention operations in history.  Mine notes Relief workers estimate there to be 34 types of landmines in Angola. There are many Russian-made mines, including the TMN-46, PMD-7-TS, M-19, PP-MI-SP, and the POMZ-2 anti-personnel mine. Activated by a tripwire, the POMZ-2 is stake mounted; rotting stakes pose a special hazard for deminers. The American M-18A1 mine has been found in Angola; with a kill radius of 50 meters, it releases 700 steel balls to cause maximum damage. The TMA-3, made in Yugoslavia, is an anti-tank mine that is non-detectable with hand-held metallic detectors (there is no metallic content in the mine fuse or body).

(Source: First!)  8 Feb 96 - The Security Council, by resolution 1045, renewed UNAVEM III's mandate for three months. The resolution expressed deep concern at ""the numerous delays in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol"". The Security Council urged the government and UNITA to maintain an effective cease-fire, conclude military talks on integrating the armed forces and actively undertake mine clearing. The UN states that joint demining, opening of raods and the free circulation of people throughout the country is imperative for national reconciliation. (Source: DPKO)  6 Feb 96 - Brian Atwood, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has sent a letter to UNITA leader Savimbi suggesting that both UNITA and the government begin to eliminate their stockpiles of landmines. (Source: HEWS)  Dec 95 - ""The whole of Angola must be considered a mined area."" That comment, made by a South African brigadier, sums up the dismal land mine situation in Angola. For three decades land mines have been used to devastating effect by a wide array of groups. ""The scope and complexity of the mine threat is probably greater than in any other country and will require a well-coordinated approach,"" notes the Executive Summary of the UN Mine Action Programme for Angola.  Roads, waterways, railroads, airports, ports, towns and private dwellings were mined in a scorched earth conflict that meant to deny the enemy land and resources that could not be held by army personnel. Bridges were mined to prevent saboteurs from attacking them; they were mined again after destruction to prevent repair work. Soldiers in retreat on both sides during the 1992 strife are reported to have mined schools, hospitals and markets.  Food supplies have been seriously affected by mines. People trapped in beseiged cities were forced to venture into mine infested areas to get to food. The 200,000 strong town of Luena, ringed by defensive minefields, is almost completely dependent on WFP food aid because the minefields have reduced the amount of land available for sustainable agriculture.  Repatriation of some 250,000 refugees from abroad, and resettlement of one million displaced persons inside Angola, is an essential part of the peace process. But the 9-15 million land mines threaten to derail peaceful repatriation and will ensure that Angola remains an economic basketcase for years to come. The mine menace poses an immediate threat to the in-coming UNAVEM III peace-keepers, mandated to hold the peace and begin a massive national reconstruction effort. The re-establishment of regional governments, and plans to hold elections may be dependent on mine clearance.  Casualties The UN estimates that 1.5% of the population has been injured in mine or UXO incidents. An ICRC survey in 1990 determined that 69% of the injured were walking on paths at the time of the blast, 15% on roads, and 16% in inhabitated areas. Angola has the highest number of amputees in the world, estimated at 70,000 in the UN's 1995 Angola Appeal. The ICRC has a rehabilitation center in Bomba Alto, where 11 staff manufacture prosthesis. Between Jan-Nov. 90, 631 new patients were fitted with prosthesis at the center, and a total of 1,127 prostheses were manufactured there for the year.  Locations The following data was provided by Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation (VVAF):  Bie Province: Severely mined. Movement is restricted by mines and the town of Kuito has been mined and remined, often with booby-traps.  Kuando Kubango Province: Severely mined. The Mavingo Valley is abandoned because of mines. In Cuito Cuanavale only 8,000 out of 33,000 planted mines have been identified.  Lunda Norte Province: Severely mined. All roads, bridges and riverbanks are considered mined.  Lunda Sul Province: Severely mined. Thirty major or strategic bridges, and 58 secondary bridges, are deswtroyed and most are surrounded by uncleared minefields.  Malanje Province: Severely mined. The municipalities of Malanje, Massango, Capunda, Quibango and Quirama are mined. Power lines and the airport are mined. Access to the hotel near the famous Kalandula Waterfalls is mined.  Moxico Province: Severely mined. The town of Luena is encircled by mines and most roads are mined.  Zaire Province: Mined. Demining operations were carried out in 1991 along major roads, though some are still mined. Border posts at M'banza Kongo-Luvo, Noqui and Beu-Fiscak are mined. Quimbele and its surroundings are mined.  Number of Mines The UN estimate for land mines in Angola is 9-15 million.  Country Statistics Existing mines:  AT 3,000,000  AP 12,000,000  total 15,000,000 Cleared mines:  AT 25,000  AP 55,000  total 80,000 Demining Capacity See Demining Programme report for Angola.  Background The end of the Cold War did not restore peace or order to this mineral rich country located in south-west Africa. Angola is 1,246,700 sq kms in area, bordered by Namibia, Zaire, Zambia and Congo. The capital city is Luanda. There are 18 provinces. The estimated population of 12,178,000 is matched by the presence of an estimated 9-15 million landmines.  The sowing of mines began in the 1960s when Portugal bitterly resisted anti-colonial movements, of which the most important were MPLA (Popular Front for the Liberation of Angola), led by Jose Eduardo Santos, and UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), led by Jonas Savimbi. The end of Portugese rule in 1975 was followed by economic collapse, civil war and military intervention by the super-powers and regional neighbors, all with an eye on Angola's extensive oil and mineral reserves.  ""While Portugese, Cuban and South African forces are known to have deployed landmines during operations in Angola, the overwhelming responsibility for landmines use lies with UNITA and the Angolan Army (FAPLA),"" report authors Roberts and Williams in After the Guns Fall Silent: The Enduring Legacy of Landmines.  Africa Watch reports that mines were an integral part of UNITA's hit-and-run war strategy: ""At one time or another, almost every part of the country was affected, as the foci of battle rapidly shifted backwards and forwards. Because of this mobility, the disruption of land communications was a major aim of UNITA, and the mining of roads, paths and bridges was consequently an important strategy."" The rebels also preferred to deploy anti-handling devices, and laid mines at random, unmarked.  In Lisbon, on 31 May 91, peace accords were signed between the MPLA and UNITA leaders as famine stalked the countryside. National elections were held under UN supervision between 29-30 Sep. 92. UNITA refused to concede defeat to the MPLA. The peace process was scuttled and war resumed.  Over the next two years, much of Angola was ruined. Over 3 million people were left dependent on food aid or humanitarian assistance. In Mar. 93 the Security Council authorized the creation of the Humanitarian Assistance Cooperation Unit (UCAH) to coordinate aid relief. On 20 Nov. 94 the Lusaka Protocol was signed, allowing for a ceasefire. UNITA accepted the election results and the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNIVEM III) began one of the most ambitious humanitarian intervention operations in history.  Mine notes Relief workers estimate there to be 34 types of landmines in Angola. There are many Russian-made mines, including the TMN-46, PMD-7-TS, M-19, PP-MI-SP, and the POMZ-2 anti-personnel mine. Activated by a tripwire, the POMZ-2 is stake mounted; rotting stakes pose a special hazard for deminers. The American M-18A1 mine has been found in Angola; with a kill radius of 50 meters, it releases 700 steel balls to cause maximum damage. The TMA-3, made in Yugoslavia, is an anti-tank mine that is non-detectable with hand-held metallic detectors (there is no metallic content in the mine fuse or body).

83,25787,[12033],Mine Action,Azerbaijan - Landmines Country Report,"Overview SITUATION - Dec. 95 - The disputed territory of Nagorno Karabakh, torn by five years of war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, has a serious mine problem. Nagorno Karabakh is a recognised part of Azeri territory, but the majority of inhabitants are Armenian, and the Azeris occupy only a small parcel of the area. The land mine problem was especially evident in the summer of 1994, when a lull in fighting allowed time for the harvest. At least 10 people were killed and many more injured by exploding mines while working in the fields, reported the Tass News Agency (23 Aug. 94). Mines seriously affect farm work throughout Nagorno Karabakh, reports the territory's Minister of Agriculture. He also told Tass that demining by self-defense units would help increase the arable area by 20%.  In Sep. 95 Halo Trust completed a mine survey of Nagorno Karabakh and decided that the number of estimated land mines in the area was 100,000. Over 30 civilian mine and UXO casualties were registered in the three months that Halo was active in Nagorno Karabakh. Halo estimates that if the population density and the land area are analysed with the number of mines, the degree of infestation is close to that in Afghanistan. Halo has trained six supervisers and 45 deminers from the local population. Halo has surveyed the regions of Martakert and Hadrut (see Location). To date, Halo has destroyed 4 tons of UXO. Halo has also started mine awareness activities through the mass media.  Locations The border area is now considered unsafe for farming because of land mines. In Martakert 130 km of mined roads and 50 sq km of minefields of various densities have been identified. Halo Trust is presently surveying Martuni, Askaran and Shushi.

The Inguri River is the front line in this conflict and the riverbanks on the Abkhaz side are mined. The Gali area of Abkhazia, which used to be overwhelmingly Georgian in ethnic make-up, is especially affected by mines. The Government of Georgia has expressed an interest in UN demining assistance, but none can be provided without similar approval from the Abkhaz side.  In Aug. 94 a UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs assessment mission to Georgia estimated there to be 75-150,000 mines between the Gumista and Inguri Rivers. Major and secondary roads are mined, and schoolchildren have been blown up taking short-cuts. The groups planting the mines may be operating as vigilantes outside the control of the Abkhaz authorities. From mid-Jan.-mid-Mar. 95 six people were killed and 15 wounded in mine incidents. Of the deaths, four were CIS peacekeepers. At present only CIS troops are clearing mines when they become a safety nuisance.  Locations The biggest concentration of mines are on the Georgian and Abkhazian sides of the Inguri River, along the coastal line of Gali Province. Ochamchira and Tkvartcheli regions are heavily mined with an estimated 27,000 land mines. There are maps documenting the minefields, but many of the mines are unmarked.  Number of Mines 75-150,000.

Background The Republic of Georgia declared independence from the USSR in 1991 and almost immediately plunged into civil war when the autonomous respublics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia seceded. By the time Eduard Shevardnadze (ex-Soviet Foreign Minister) was elected to the presidency on 11 Oct. 92, the federal army was falling back, and in Sep. 94 the capital of Abkhazia, Sukhumi, fell to the rebels.  The front line in the conflict extends along the Inguri River. In May 94 a ceasefire came into effect and Russian and other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) troops moved in to hold the uneasy peace. On 26 Nov. 94 the Supreme Soviet of Abkhazia unilaterally declared a sovereign republic, adopted a new constitution, and declared itself bound by international law. No international diplomatic recognition has been extended to Abkhazia. On 12 May 95 the UN Security Council extended the UNOMIG mandate until Jan. 96.

(Source: UN/DPKO)  Overview SITUATION - Dec. 95 - Rwanda has a serious land mine problem because of the ethnic and political conflagration that engulfed this tiny, landlocked nation located in Central Africa between Apr. and Jul. 94.  The new National Demining Office, established under a US-Rwanda bilateral arrangement, estimates there are 250,000 mines to be cleared, primarily in the north-west, north-east, and Central (Kigali) areas. In recent weeks there has been a noticeable increase in mine casualties and incidents, largely attributed to terrorist elements exploiting the presence of 1 million refugees camped in Zaire. Vehicles belonging to relief groups have been targeted, including an ICRC truck which struck an AT mine in Sep. 95, wounding 23 people out of 54 aboard.  In May 95 a team from the US Department of Defense visited Kigali as part of a bilateral agreement to undertake demining activities. As part of the US$105 million budget, the US has trained 85 active military personnel with the Rwandan Army, and will provide 18 sniffer dogs (see Demining Capacity). The US demining company Ronco assumed the follow-up management tasks after the last US personnel departed 2 Oct. 95. The US also provided 250 metal detectors for the project. The US also moved to have the arms embargo curtailing the import the import of explosvies into Rwanda lifted by action of the UN Security Council (acting under Chapter VII of the Charter).

Background The two most populous ethnic groups in Rwanda are the majority Hutu and the minority Tutsi. The Tutsi lost their centuries long traditional domination of political, social and economic life after decolonisation, when the French departed and the Hutu won majority rule in 1962. Ethnic tensions have surfaced several times since independence.  In 1993 exiled Tutsi rebels, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), made it to the gates of Kigali before being turned back by French-backed government troops. After a ceasefire and mediation the preseidents of Rwanda and Burundi were set to sign a peace settlement when their aircraft was shot down on 6 Apr. 94, allegedly by Hutu hardliners in the Rwandan government who opposed their president's peace initiative.  The assassinations sparked a wave of blood-letting that pitted armed mobs of Hutu against the Tutsi population. Moderate Hutu were also targeted. An estimated 750,000-1 million people perished in massacres. sparking what UNHCR described as ""the largest and festest refugee exodus in history."" The RPF emerged from the countryside and stormed into Kigali on 4 Jul. 94, ousting the new Hutu leadership. An estimated 1 million Hutu fled the Tutsi take-over, fearing reprisals for the massacres. French military intervention on 22 Jun. 94 was said to be aimed at restoring order. In Dec. 95 UNICEF estimated that some 300,000 children died in the strife, and that many continue to be killed by uncleared mines and UXO littering the cities and countryside.

EAST AFRICA 1: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA 1. Burundi a) Interior of the country remains troubled; situation in Gitega deteriorates dramatically.  b) Southern Kayanza province inaccessible; MSF-Holland staff evacuated. c) French military to leave by 2 June; remainder of French community advised to leave. 2. Zaire - Goma a) New Zairian operation launched against elements fighting in the Masisi region. Hunde and Nandi villagers near Mweso areunder threat from Hutu who have surrounded the village. b) Tutsis who fled from Motoko to Kichanga are now heading towards Rwanda. c) WFP vehicle attacked near airport military aviation unit on 23 May. Equipment stolen but later returned. d) CARE restricts movement of personnel and trucks amid continued concern for security on road north of Goma. 3. Tanzania a) Further restriction on movement on refugees in Ngara area announced by Government of Tanzania, effective 1 July. 4. Rwanda a) Downward trend in repatriation from neighbouring countries continues. b) A further 817 Zairian refugees arrive in Rwanda. C. EAST AFRICA 1: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA 1. BURUNDI 1.1 The Burundi/Zairian border remains closed. 1.2 The interior of the country remains troubled with sporadic fighting in Cibitoke, Bururi, Kayanza, Karuzi, Bujumbura and Bujumbura Rural. Skirmishes between military and rebel forces in these provinces over the past week have lead to casualties and many injured. The security situation in Gitega is worsening dramatically and is seriously affected with a high death toll in the Swahili neighbourhood of the town centre. 1.3 Southern areas in Kayanza province remain entirely inaccessible. Planned distributions in Buraniro (1,048 beneficiaries) and Gasenyi (5,833 beneficiaries) had to be cancelled until further notice, following evacuation of MSF-Holland staff. Distributions in Gahombo (436 beneficiaries) and Muhanga (6,413 beneficiaries) were carried out. 1.4 The French school in Bujumbura is closing, and all French military personnel in the country are to leave by 2 June; the rest of the French community although not being evacuated are being advised to leave. No official reason was given but it is assumed to be for security reasons. 1.5 Total caseload in Gitega province estimated at 90,779 beneficiaries. Since the initiation of ad hoc distributions in April, WFP has covered more than 76 per cent of needs (69,311 beneficiaries/544 mt food). 1.6 On 21 May, a manifestation of 800 people organized by the Union for National Progress (UPRONA) party was held in Bujumbura, calling for the closure of the office of the UN Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG) and protesting against all foreign military operations in the region. 1.7 The Great Lakes Regional Meeting on Refugee Issues in Geneva has ended. Its main recommendation is an intensified information campaign within the refugee camps to promote repatriation. 1.8 No tangible effect on repatriation outflow of Rwandan refugees from Burundi reported as an outcome of the visit of the Tripartite Commission on Repatriation of Rwandan Refugees. Only about 200 Rwandan refugees have repatriated this week. The last transfer of Rwandan refugees from Rukuramigabo camp is scheduled 29 May. Transfer of 3,660 refugees from Kibezi camp to Magara camp in Ngozi is under way and should be completed by end of month. 2. ZAIRE - GOMA 2.1 Fighting continues in Masisi region. In response to heavy military losses, the Forces Armes Zairoises (FAZ) launched operation Mbata (""slap"") against Nigilima in Rutshuru area. According to the military authorities, over 100 Nigilima militia and civilians have been killed. A tea plantation in a Hunde and Nandi village near Mweso has been surrounded by Hutu who are expected to attack the village in the next few days. 2.2 Tutsis from Motoko (site of a serious attack early in the week of 12 May, in which an unknown number of people were killed), who had fled to Kichanga, have now started moving towards the Rwanda border at Gisenyi. An estimated 1,000 of this group have been transported to within one kilometre of the border by private means. 2.3 A WFP vehicle carrying three staff members was attacked near the airport military aviation unit on 23 May. Equipment and personal belongings were stolen but later returned. 2.4 Following the ambush of vehicles reported last week, CARE did not permit their social services personnel to go to the camps. In additions, inter-camp transfers were interrupted for two days when CARE restricted movements of trucking fleet due to concerns about insecurity on the corridor north of Goma. 2.5 Repair work is progressing along the Ishasha road, which is once again open to WFP trucks. The bridge at Puzi is still under repair. WFP is rebuilding stock levels as a result of the Ishasha road being reopened to traffic. 3. ZAIRE - BUKAVU 3.1 The security situation in Inera camp continues to beprecarious. Fourteen refugees from this camp were transferred to Kinshasa, charged with intimidating refugees against repatriation. 3.2 On Idjwi Island several security incidents reported between the local population and the refugees. 3.3 Two local NGOs, Adi Kivu (supported by CARITAS) and Nyakavogo, carried out their first direct distribution to heads of households 20-26 May. 18 out of 24 camps now distribute rations directly to heads of households. 4. ZAIRE - UVIRA 4.1 Problems with fuel supplies for humanitarian agencies in Uvira seem to have been solved, as a special delivery to Bukavu is planned for UNHCR and its partners. Supplies of fuel for WFP (for generators and light vehicles) are being ensured from barge tanks. 5. TANZANIA 5.1 Owing to border closure (to refugee movements) between Tanzania and Burundi, UNHCR is unable to provide accurate figures of new Burundian arrivals into Ngara region. However, an estimated daily average of 80 to 100 persons is reported. 5.2 The Government of Tanzania and UNHCR have informed refugees that the restriction on movement to a maximum of four kilometres outside the camps (to be effected in Ngara camps from 1 July) means that refugees are no longer allowed to live in neighbouring villages. The move will also affect farming activities. 5.3 Following discussions on caseload figures in the Karagwe camps, WFP, UNHCR and camp management have agreed to a total of 124,046 persons as an official caseload figure for the camps in the region. 5.4 The community food distribution system, now used in the Karagwe camps, is to be adopted in the Kigoma camps. 5.5 As of 26 May, the refugee population is reported as being 638,450. 6. RWANDA 6.1 Transit centres in Rwanda received 720 returnees from 21 to 27 May, confirming the downward trend in the level of refugees returning to Rwanda. 6.2 Some 817 Zairian refugees arrived in Rwanda 21-27 May. UNHCR reports from Zaire continue to speak about a possible influx of an additional 6,000 people who are currently displaced in the Goma area.

EAST AFRICA 1: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA 1. BURUNDI 1.1 The Burundi/Zairian border remains closed. 1.2 The interior of the country remains troubled with sporadic fighting in Cibitoke, Bururi, Kayanza, Karuzi, Bujumbura and Bujumbura Rural. Skirmishes between military and rebel forces in these provinces over the past week have lead to casualties and many injured. The security situation in Gitega is worsening dramatically and is seriously affected with a high death toll in the Swahili neighbourhood of the town centre. 1.3 Southern areas in Kayanza province remain entirely inaccessible. Planned distributions in Buraniro (1,048 beneficiaries) and Gasenyi (5,833 beneficiaries) had to be cancelled until further notice, following evacuation of MSF-Holland staff. Distributions in Gahombo (436 beneficiaries) and Muhanga (6,413 beneficiaries) were carried out. 1.4 The French school in Bujumbura is closing, and all French military personnel in the country are to leave by 2 June; the rest of the French community although not being evacuated are being advised to leave. No official reason was given but it is assumed to be for security reasons. 1.5 Total caseload in Gitega province estimated at 90,779 beneficiaries. Since the initiation of ad hoc distributions in April, WFP has covered more than 76 per cent of needs (69,311 beneficiaries/544 mt food). 1.6 On 21 May, a manifestation of 800 people organized by the Union for National Progress (UPRONA) party was held in Bujumbura, calling for the closure of the office of the UN Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG) and protesting against all foreign military operations in the region. 1.7 The Great Lakes Regional Meeting on Refugee Issues in Geneva has ended. Its main recommendation is an intensified information campaign within the refugee camps to promote repatriation. 1.8 No tangible effect on repatriation outflow of Rwandan refugees from Burundi reported as an outcome of the visit of the Tripartite Commission on Repatriation of Rwandan Refugees. Only about 200 Rwandan refugees have repatriated this week. The last transfer of Rwandan refugees from Rukuramigabo camp is scheduled 29 May. Transfer of 3,660 refugees from Kibezi camp to Magara camp in Ngozi is under way and should be completed by end of month. 2. ZAIRE - GOMA 2.1 Fighting continues in Masisi region. In response to heavy military losses, the Forces Armes Zairoises (FAZ) launched operation Mbata (""slap"") against Nigilima in Rutshuru area. According to the military authorities, over 100 Nigilima militia and civilians have been killed. A tea plantation in a Hunde and Nandi village near Mweso has been surrounded by Hutu who are expected to attack the village in the next few days. 2.2 Tutsis from Motoko (site of a serious attack early in the week of 12 May, in which an unknown number of people were killed), who had fled to Kichanga, have now started moving towards the Rwanda border at Gisenyi. An estimated 1,000 of this group have been transported to within one kilometre of the border by private means. 2.3 A WFP vehicle carrying three staff members was attacked near the airport military aviation unit on 23 May. Equipment and personal belongings were stolen but later returned. 2.4 Following the ambush of vehicles reported last week, CARE did not permit their social services personnel to go to the camps. In additions, inter-camp transfers were interrupted for two days when CARE restricted movements of trucking fleet due to concerns about insecurity on the corridor north of Goma. 2.5 Repair work is progressing along the Ishasha road, which is once again open to WFP trucks. The bridge at Puzi is still under repair. WFP is rebuilding stock levels as a result of the Ishasha road being reopened to traffic. 3. ZAIRE - BUKAVU 3.1 The security situation in Inera camp continues to beprecarious. Fourteen refugees from this camp were transferred to Kinshasa, charged with intimidating refugees against repatriation. 3.2 On Idjwi Island several security incidents reported between the local population and the refugees. 3.3 Two local NGOs, Adi Kivu (supported by CARITAS) and Nyakavogo, carried out their first direct distribution to heads of households 20-26 May. 18 out of 24 camps now distribute rations directly to heads of households. 4. ZAIRE - UVIRA 4.1 Problems with fuel supplies for humanitarian agencies in Uvira seem to have been solved, as a special delivery to Bukavu is planned for UNHCR and its partners. Supplies of fuel for WFP (for generators and light vehicles) are being ensured from barge tanks. 5. TANZANIA 5.1 Owing to border closure (to refugee movements) between Tanzania and Burundi, UNHCR is unable to provide accurate figures of new Burundian arrivals into Ngara region. However, an estimated daily average of 80 to 100 persons is reported. 5.2 The Government of Tanzania and UNHCR have informed refugees that the restriction on movement to a maximum of four kilometres outside the camps (to be effected in Ngara camps from 1 July) means that refugees are no longer allowed to live in neighbouring villages.

EAST AFRICA 1: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA 1. REGIONAL 1.1 The WFP Assistant Executive Director, Mr. Jean-Jacques Graisse, visited the sub-region 11-15 June. Mr. Graisse met WFP staff and humanitarian organisation representatives in Kigali, Bukavu, Bujumbura and Ngozi and held several official meetings in all countries visited. In a meeting with the President of Burundi Mr. Graisse reconfirmed that WFP will remain in Burundi, carrying out necessary operations as long as security conditions permit. The Assistant Executive Director also had the opportunity to look at WFP sponsored food-for-work projects in housing construction in Rwanda and the warehouses and the camps of Inera and Kashusha in Bukavu. 2. BURUNDI 2.1 A grenade exploded at the site of a food distribution in the Rukuramigabo camp in Kirundo province on 13 June. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, UNHCR/WFP implementing partner, was carrying out food distributions at the time of the explosion, which resulted in some 68 wounded, five of whom are in critical condition. 2.2 Most NGOs have restarted activities at the end of a week of mourning for the International Committee of the Red Cross delegates killed on 4 June. WFP activities have continued in Ngozi and Bujumbura, and will recommence in Gitega 19 June, two days later than anticipated, due to technical problems with the Twin Otter aircraft. 2.3 Security incidents continue throughout the country. On 13 June, in Rutegama (Muramvya province) between 70 and 100 civilians are reported to have been killed. Several houses were burned on 14 June in Kibimba hill. 2.4 Kabezi commune of Bujumbura Rural has been the site of a series of attacks since early June. Approximately 50 persons were killed on 12 June. A large portion of the population has gathered at the administrative centre of the commune and around the parish of Mutambu (Masama, Kitenga, Citwe). The areas of Migera, Ramba and Mutumba are presently empty of inhabitants. Insecurity has prevented WFP from delivering 30 mt food commodities for the 5,000 beneficiaries. The Matambu parish collected 24 mt, part delivered to the commune of Kabezi, while the remaining distributed directly to dispersed persons around Mutambu parish. An additional 6 mt will be delivered on 19 June to IDPs at Masama, Kitenga and Citwe. CRS will distribute non-food items to 3,800 persons. 2.5 Italian volunteers, nuns and priests living and working at the Parish of Mutoyi in Ruyigi province were evacuated from the area on 16 June following attacks which took place on 11 June, and threats on their lives. The Butezi hospital and six surrounding health centres have been emptied. 2.6 The office of Action Contre la Faim was looted in Ngozi marking the second attack in ten days. Action Contre la Faim has temporarily suspended some of its activities. 2.7 As a direct result of the grenade explosion in the Rukuramigabo camp, and other security incidents in the northern refugee camps, WFP/UNHCR have agreed to move distribution cycles from every two weeks to once every month in Rukuramigabo camp, and once every three weeks in the other three camps (Ruvumu, Kibezi and Magara) in Ngozi. 2.8 Two French nationals were victims of armed attacks in Bujumbura and were evacuated for medical treatment in France. 2.9 The third round of Mwanza peace talks in Tanzania, with the participation of representatives from 18 of Burundi's political parties as well as representatives from the Presidency and the Bureau of the Prime Minister, began on 17 June, one week after the last round ended. Talks were expected to last for two days. 3. ZAIRE - GOMA 3.1 The general security situation remains tense in Goma. Zairian Contingent soldiers found two mines on the north corridor 8 km south of Kibumba camp. 3.2 Following a prolonged calm in Masisi central, the Hunde are returning in large numbers in military-escorted convoys. 3.3 Most of the Tutsi population has left the Kichanga area in Masisi for Rwanda. 3.4 Several civilians and some rebels were reported killed in skirmishes between the military involved in the Mbata (""slap"") campaign and the Ngilima rebels in the Rutshuru area. 3.5 WFP reopened the Bunagana office on 16 June (closed on 5 June following attack on the Bunagana village). At present, the Bunagana border area is quiet, but the local military remain uneasy about the security situation along this route. 3.6 UNHCR has postponed the census in the Goma camps to August 1996. 3.7 A total of 86 trucks crossed the Bunagana border from 10-16 June. WFP-Goma received a total of 2,296 mt and dispatched 530 mt by barge to Bukavu. 4. ZAIRE - BUKAVU 4.1 The registration operation, which began during the week of 3-9 June, continued in several camps. In other camps, the operation was suspended due to cheating. Food delivery last week was carried out only in camps where the registration operation was completed and the results were approved. WFP and UNHCR have announced to the refugees that in camps where population figures are still not agreed upon food will not be delivered until the matter is resolved. 4.2 The numerous security incidents near Goma reported over the last several weeks hampered to some degree WFP's ability to maintain a steady flow of food deliveries to Goma and Bukavu via the northern corridor. 5. ZAIRE - UVIRA 5.1 Zairian border with Burundi remains closed. WFP continues enhanced Kigoma-Uvira barge operation to ensure continuity of Uvira and Bukavu pipeline. Some 3,770 mt food commodities on three barges is presently being loaded in Kigoma for Uvira. These barges are booked for two rotations, which will enable a total uplift of 5,900 mt from Kigoma in the next two weeks. This barge capacity will help to significantly reduce the current stock build-up in the port of Kigoma. This build-up has been primarily due to increased barge activity on the lake, and subsequent increased competition for available capacity, resulting from the Burundi/Zaire border closure. 5.2 New sites have been identified by UNHCR in Uvira for a possible influx of refugees from Burundi, with an estimated operational capacity of 90,000 persons. 5.3 Population in Uvira camps is at 189,144 (117,316 Burundian and 71,828 Rwandan). 6. TANZANIA 6.1 New arrivals have brought the refugee population of Keza camp to 40,689, and the camp, established to accommodate new refugees temporarily until their relocation to other camps, is reaching full capacity. 6.2 During the reporting week the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the Tanzanian Red Cross Society officially handed over Keza camp management to the International Refugee Committee. 6.3 Kigoma region continues to receive new arrivals. A total of 501 refugees arrived during the reporting period. 280 entered through Kanembwa, the remainder through Mtabila. 7. RWANDA 7.1 The last week witnessed a number of security incidents in Kibuye (detection of new anti-tank mines on roads), Gikongoro (sporadic cases of insurgency and land mines) and the north- east (sabotage of a water facility in Tabagwe). 7.2 Following a decision made last week by the UN Security Coordinator for Rwanda, the UN agencies have started using the road through Nyungwe forest (between Gikongoro and Cyangugu) only in organised convoys. Several convoys have already passed without incidents and are expected to continue at least three times a week. 7.3 The Prefects of the two most tense Prefectures of Rwanda, Cyangugu and Gisenyi, were replaced last week, reportedly due to their unsatisfactory conduct in security matters. 7.4 A total of 1,040 Zairian refugees entered Rwanda last week, bringing the 1996 total to 13,984 persons. The majority of the refugees are assisted in Umubano camp in Gisenyi, 1,324 await transfer from Nkamira returnee centre and 1,300 from the former CARE transit centre. The previous week some 570 Zairian refugees had arrived. 7.5 Owing to the general poor health and nutritional condition of the Umubano camp population, WFP will increase the general food aid ration by 100 gr of beans per person daily, raising the kilocalorie content to 2,314. EC will provide the additional quantities of food required. Following two to three months of increased distributions, the nutritional situation in the camp will be re-assessed.","WFP Emergency Report No. 24 of 1996: East Africa B.

TANZANIA 6.1 New arrivals have brought the refugee population of Keza camp to 40,689, and the camp, established to accommodate new refugees temporarily until their relocation to other camps, is reaching full capacity. 6.2 During the reporting week the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the Tanzanian Red Cross Society officially handed over Keza camp management to the International Refugee Committee. 6.3 Kigoma region continues to receive new arrivals.

91,26051,[4589],Contributions,Canada and Burundi,"Background Situated in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa, Burundi covers an area of about 28,000 square kilometres. Its population of just over six million is divided into two ethnic groups: the majority Hutus and the minority Tutsis, who have nevertheless traditionally held power. Burundi is the most densely populated African country after Rwanda. Its people speak Kinyarundi and French. It is an almost exclusively agricultural country of high plateaus. Nearly 92% of the labour force is employed in agriculture, especially in growing coffee, tea and cotton. The remaining economic activity is based largely on nickel and phosphate mining. There is virtually no processing industry. Over-development, land fragmentation, deforestation and soil erosion are other problems that seriously threaten agriculture and forestry. As in most Central African countries, the prevalence of HIV remains very high, especially in Bujumbura. Despite significant progress in education since the country's independence, nearly half of children between seven and 12 years of age do not attend primary school. Most women are illiterate and unable to participate fully in the economic and social development of Burundi society. Health services are inadequate, and there is only one doctor for every 25,000 inhabitants. According to UNICEF, moreover, only 70% of the population has access to potable water, and less than one third has access to electricity. Burundi became independent from Belgium in 1962. In recent decades, it has experienced significant internal difficulties and fratricidal struggles that have led thousands of Burundis to take refuge in neighbouring countries. The situation has worsened considerably since President Melchior Ndadaye was assassinated on October 21, 1993, and the country is in the throes of an unprecedented political crisis. It is estimated that more than 250,000 Burundis have sought refuge in bordering countries, not including another 100,000 displaced within Burundi. The Convention on Government of September 1994, which calls for the sharing of power between the majority Hutus and the minority Tutsis, has been undermined by extremists on both sides. Tutsi militias have expelled Hutus from the mixed neighbourhoods of Bujumbura, the nation's capital. Hutu militias, based in Zaire and supported by the army of the former government of Rwanda, are leading a growing rebellion. A state of emergency was declared on June 18, 1995, in an attempt to avoid civil war. Since February 1995, the international community has sought to bring about a settlement of the conflict by focusing its efforts on preventive diplomacy and trying to convince Burundi leaders to find a peaceful solution to the crisis. Canada supports this approach. All of this upheaval has seriously affected Burundi's economy. Burundi is one of the world's poorest countries, and its leaders are finding it very difficult to get the economy moving again. The present conflict is beginning to have an impact on the Government of Burundi's financial management. Relations between Canada and Burundi Canada has maintained diplomatic relations with Burundi since 1969. However, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has been active in Burundi since the country's independence in the early 1960s. Burundi has an embassy in Ottawa, and Canada has a consulate in Bujumbura, directed by an honorary consul. Canada's High Commissioner in Nairobi, Kenya, is accredited to Burundi. In February 1995, Mrs. Christine Stewart, Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), led the Canadian delegation to the Regional Conference on Assistance to Refugees, Returnees and Displaced Persons in the Great Lakes Region of Africa, in Bujumbura. On Canada's initiative, participants at the conference agreed to lend their unconditional support to Burundi's democratic political forces, to produce a declaration defending the power-sharing agreement, and to support the president's request for a judicial inquiry by the United Nations into the assassination of President Ndadaye. At the meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of La Francophonie in Paris on March 30, 1995, Canada proposed that the organization assume a more active role in preventive diplomacy in Central Africa. Thus, a joint delegation of representatives from the Francophone Ministers' Conference, the International Association of French-Speaking Parliamentarians, the Permanent Council of La Francophonie, and the Cultural and Technical Cooperation Agency visited Burundi from April 12 to 15 to show that francophone countries supported the government's moderate leadership and to condemn the actions of extremists. Three members of the Canadian Armed Forces were sent to Burundi in March 1995 to give a three-week course on human rights to members of Burundi's armed forces, sponsored by the UN Centre for Human Rights. In July 1994, to contribute to the search for sustainable solutions to the problems of Burundi and the region, Canada appointed Ambassador Bernard Dussault as special envoy to Central Africa. Mr. Dussault undertook several missions to the governments of the region, the Organization of African Unity, the UN agencies concerned and the governments of donor countries. Humanitarian and Development Assistance On September 24, 1990, the Canadian International Development Agency signed a co-operation agreement with Burundi authorities. Under this agreement, Canada made a commitment to provide substantial humanitarian and technical assistance to Burundi, and to work to improve the country's infrastructure. Key areas of co-operation were education, village water supply and energy. In February 1993, the bilateral aid program in Burundi had to be suspended as a result of budget cuts affecting several CIDA assistance programs. However, the Agency continued to assist Burundi's poorest through its multilateral program. A $500,000 fund was also created in July 1994 to support projects promoting respect for human rights and democratic development in Burundi. As a result of the current fragile political situation in Burundi, Canada is focusing its efforts on humanitarian assistance and democratic development programs. Since the political crisis erupted in October 1993, CIDA has disbursed over $14 million in humanitarian assistance. These funds were disbursed to international organizations and Canadian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to assist the victims of the conflict, particularly abandoned children, and to facilitate the return of refugees and displaced persons. Canada has also provided emergency humanitarian assistance to supply food and potable water. CIDA is currently working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Burundi authorities to develop a Canadian intervention strategy to respond to the present crisis. On June 17 and 18 in Geneva, with other agencies from a dozen countries and several international organizations, the Agency will also examine the key components of a possible development assistance program for the short-, medium- and long-term reconstruction of Burundi. The meeting will also allow an examination of possible initiatives to resolve the conflict and to put Burundi on the road to sustainable peace. A small number of Canadian NGOs and religious organizations have also worked in Burundi since the early 1960s. They specialize mainly in vocational training and assistance to the poorest, and receive support from CIDA. Consular Assistance In late May 1996, there were 87 Canadians registered in Burundi, 75 of them in Bujumbura. This number includes missionaries and employees of NGOs dedicated to humanitarian assistance. A consular warning is in effect, recommending that Canadians postpone their plans to travel to Burundi. Canadians living in Burundi are being encouraged to leave the country immediately by the safest means. An emergency radio system is in place at the Canadian consulate in Bujumbura to ensure contact with Canadian nationals in Burundi. Immigration Measures No special program has been developed for Burundi refugees, since international organizations encourage refugees to return to their country instead of settling in a third country. However, the visa department of Canada's High Commission in Nairobi, Kenya, continues to handle the claims of refugees sponsored by private groups.

92,26779,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,CARE Emergency Update - Burundi,"by Clarice Taylor,  CARE Emergency Assistance Unit Information Officer  BURUNDI Beleaguered by civil conflict for the past three years, Burundi was the scene of a bloodless coup d'etat on July 24. After being pelted by stones at the funeral of Tutsi women and children, President Ntibantunganya, the constitutional Head of State, took refuge at the residence of the American Ambassador. The following day, Pierre Buyoya, the former Tutsi President who led Burundi to democratic elections in 1993, was named interim president. The overthrow of the coalition Government which ruled the country since 1993, had been brewing for several days with the collapse of a fragile power-sharing agreement called the ""Convention du Government.""  Despite early pronouncements by some western governments, including the United States, that any government which came to power through the use of force would not be recognized, ther appears to be a tentative opening to Mr. Buyoya's presidency. He is seen as a moderate who could prove to be a stabilizing influence in the ongoing war of ethnic violence and retribution. However, the Organization for African Unity (OAU) condemned the coup and refused to acknowledge Buyoya's presidency. In addition, at a meeting on July 31 in Arusha, the majority of the leaders of Great Lakes countries called for economic sanctions against Burundi. And there is concern among several international agencies, including CARE, that sanctions be carefully targeted to affect the belligerents rather than placing the burden on the poor, as happened in Haiti.  Security remains a very real concern in Burundi. Following the murder of three International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) staff in June, relief agencies, including CARE, temporarily suspended operations in a show of solidarity. The closure of the Burundi-Zaire border in May 1996 has resulted in an increased difficulty in managing the our Uvira operations from the Burundi/Bujumbura office. In the Uvira camps, CARE is involved in most aspects of camp management: warehouse management for non-food items; road rehabilitation; food distribution to the entire camp population. Currently, that number is at about 190,000 refugees (this figure includes some 70,000 Rwandans), and the arrival over the past two months of an additional 50,000 refugees has prompted the UN to explore a new site. In spite of constraints, CARE continues its program activities inside Burundi. CARE's provision of shelter and water to internally displaced persons and local residents also attempts to bring together divided communities by working on very concrete common goals. As funding becomes more difficult to access because of the security environment, the CARE's Emergency Group has sought to support CARE- Burundi in its efforts to secure funding needed to continue and expand its work.

From B. Szynalski, Director, Operational Policy and Support Division. For information regarding resources, donors are requested to contact Mr. F. Strippoli or Mr. M. Crosthwaite, WFP Rome (Ph. 39 6 5228 2504 or 5228 2004) A. EAST AFRICA 1: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA 1. Burundi a) No improvement in precarious security situation throughout the country. Protest demonstrations continue in Bujumbura. b) Parts of Muyinga province described as completely empty of inhabitants. 2. Zaire - Goma a) Security incidents in Goma town diminish as off-duty soldiers forbidden to carry guns. b) Villagers returning to the Masisi area are returning to destroyed and pillaged homes. Some insecurity continues; reported Hutu attack on Hunde villages in Bitonga results in 35 deaths and 3,000 displaced. 3. Zaire - Bukavu a) Grenade explodes in Inera camp killing two persons, seriously injuring others. b) Further incidents on the escarpment road between Bukavu and Uvira; reportedly heavy artillery fire from across the Rwandan border directed on vehicles using the road; Zairian soldiers guarding the road return fire. 4. Tanzania a) New camp opened in Kibondo district (Mtendele camp) to accommodate new arrivals from Burundi. 5. Rwanda a) FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission Report released. Mission estimated 1996 food production 15 percent higher than 1995 production. Import requirements total 64,000 mt of which some 44,000 mt is required as food aid. A. EAST AFRICA 1: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA 1. REGIONAL 1.1 A mission with USAID Food for Peace and the US Embassy in Kampala with WFP participation completed its review of USAID assistance to the Great Lakes Region. The mission also met European Community regional representatives in Bujumbura to discuss common issues of interest under the Regional operation. 2. BURUNDI 2.1 Insecurity continues to be precarious throughout the country. In Rutovu commune of Bururi province, a grenade exploded in an elementary school on 9 July resulting in a reported six deaths and 17 injuries. Ambushes continue in Cibitoke. In Muramvya, rebels attacked a cheese factory and an attack on a military-escorted convoy led to one soldier killed and another wounded. 2.2 Due to new reports of violence, including recent deaths of some 50 persons, in the Kabezi area of Bujumbura rural, WFP received a request from the local parish for food assistance for 12,252 persons. WFP is assessing the situation. 2.3 The situation in Buhinyuza and Mwakiro communes in Muyinga province is very tense; many areas are completely empty of inhabitants. 2.4 Regular WFP operations are still on hold in the Gitega/ Karuzi area due to insecurity, and all staff remain in Bujumbura. No further requests have been made to WFP for food assistance in either Gitega or Karuzi following recent distributions in both areas. 2.5 The Burundian members of the Technical Committee, in charge of studying the criteria for an intervention force as per the recommendations of the Arusha summit, met on 16 July and are expected to issue the conclusions of their report to the National Security Council by 20 July. This report will later be submitted to the International Technical Committee, presided by Julius Nyerere. 2.6 Demonstrations continue in Bujumbura protesting the proposed deployment of an international intervention force in Burundi. On 15 July, there was a further protest march by university and high school students. 3. ZAIRE - GOMA 3.1 Security incidents in Goma town have diminished following new military order which forbids off-duty soldiers to carry guns. Serious security incidents in and around the camps have also fallen off. 3.2 Two WFP truck drivers were robbed at gunpoint on theaccess road to Goma port on Lake Kivu after their trucks were unloaded at the port. 3.3 The situation in the Masisi area is relatively calm. Villagers are continuing to return their home villages. However, the villagers are returning to destroyed and pillaged homes, all their livestock stolen or slaughtered, and fields neglected. Insecurity is still a problem in parts of the area, with incidents reported in Bitonga in the south and Mweso in the north. In Bitonga, a reported Hutu attack on Hunde villages lasted four days and resulted in 35 deaths and 3,000 displaced. 3.4 Firewood provision to the camps is improving with the gradual calming of the security situation in the region and the opening of the Goma-Butembo road. 3.5 The results of a nutritional survey in Kibumba camp have shown a significant improvement. The 8.3 percent of global malnutrition found in November 1995 fell to 3.5 percent in July 1996. A nutritional survey in the fifth and final camp took place on 15 July. Results should be available next reporting week. 3.6 From 8 to 14 July WFP Goma received a total of 2,993 mt of commodities. A total of 543 mt were dispatched to Bukavu. 4. ZAIRE - BUKAVU 4.1 A grenade exploded in Inera camp on 10 July killing a woman and a girl and seriously injuring several others. 4.2 On 12 July Zairian soldiers guarding the escarpment road which leads to Uvira returned fire on Rwanda after reportedly heavy artillery fire from across the border was directed on trucks and buses travelling the Zairian road. However this has not affected the delivery of relief food to Bukavu. 4.3 The general caseload for the Bukavu camps has been temporarily set at 294,978 beneficiaries. Verification of population figures goes ahead slowly in the camps. WFP Bukavu is monitoring the operation very closely to ensure the validity of the final figures. 4.4 Delivery of rations except for CSB completed in all camps except for Kabira and Nyamirangwe which were on stand-by for a verification of population figures and are scheduled for deliveries next week. CSB will be delivered to all camps once received. 4.5 Reception of food aid supplies almost doubled compared to previous week due to a continued increasing flow of food from the northern route and an increased capacity of WFP-leased trucks on the southern route from Uvira. 5. ZAIRE - UVIRA 5.1 Up to 500 refugees from the Cibitoke area have been fleeing to Uvira daily over the period 10-16 July. 5.2 Official refugee population in Uvira now totals 191,922 persons. This figure reflects the results of the census operation in all eleven camps as well as the recent arrival of some 6,000 new refugees. 6. TANZANIA 6.1 A new camp, called Mtendele, opened in Kibondo district to accommodate new arrivals from Burundi. The camp, which is located 2.5 km from the Kibondo-Nyakanazi road, has a current population of 288 refugees. A Tanzanian NGO will be responsible for food distribution and camp management, while the International Refugee Committee will cover health and sanitation services for refugees. 6.2 UNHCR, the Ministry of Home Affairs and NGOs are studying the possibility of opening a new camp in Kasulu district for the continuing flow of Burundian refugees into that area. 6.3 A total of 445 Burundian refugees arrived between 8 and 14 July and were registered at Mtabila and Kanembwa camps in the Kigoma region. 6.4 Total refugee population as at 14 July is 644,267. 7. RWANDA 7.1 FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission Report concluded and released. Similar to the findings of the preceding season, an increase of 7 percent was noted in the planted area. This reflects improved stability in the interior of Rwanda and resumption of regular agricultural activities by a considerable number of returning refugees. The Mission estimated the output of this season (1996 B) to be 181,000 mt (cereals and pulses). Import requirements total 64,000 mt ofwhich some 44,000 mt is required as food aid. Food production for the whole of 1996 is estimated to be 15 percent higher than in 1995 but still remains 23 percent below pre-crisis level in 1990. In terms of per capita production, considering the smaller number of people in 1996, this year's result is 14 percent below the 1990 level. 7.2 A WFP Management Review Mission is scheduled for September 1996. Issues to be reviewed will include level of assistance and overall programming matters. 7.3 During the past week high government officials (Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Interior and Agriculture Ministers and Parliament members) paid visits to Cyangugu, Gisenyi and Kibuye. Security and the refugee situation were the main items on the agenda. 7.4 Human rights agencies in Rwanda reported that the month of June witnessed a record increase in numbers of attacks on genocide survivors and witnesses. The total for 1996 is 98 attacks with at least 80 casualties. In Kibuye and Cyangugu, a move of survivors from imminent border areas deeper into the interior has been noticed as a consequence. The President of Rwanda has pledged that the Government will make new efforts to support and protect these vulnerable groups. 7.5 Caseload of the supplementary feeding programme for Masisi refugees is anticipated to rise from current 1,400 beneficiaries to around 2,000. WFP will continue to provide 1,000 food rations and CRS will supply the rest. 7.6 Zairian refugees continue to arrive to Gisenyi, though in much smaller numbers than before. 7.7 New refugees from Burundi also continue to arrive with some 500 persons registered between 9-15 July. There are currently 3,427 Burundian refugees located at Bugarama communal office (Cyangugu). UNHCR and the Government of Rwanda have agreed to a plan to move the camp to a new, more permanent site (also in Bugarama). WFP continues to provide food to all refugees through communal kitchens established and run by the NGO Concern. Ninety unaccompanied children among the refugees are cared for separately.","WFP Emergency Report No. 28 of 1996: East Africa This report includes: A) Burundi, Rwanda, Zaire and Tanzania B) Uganda and Sudan C) Liberia.

Zaire - Goma a) Security incidents in Goma town diminish as off-duty soldiers forbidden to carry guns. b) Villagers returning to the Masisi area are returning to destroyed and pillaged homes. Some insecurity continues; reported Hutu attack on Hunde villages in Bitonga results in 35 deaths and 3,000 displaced. 3. Zaire - Bukavu a) Grenade explodes in Inera camp killing two persons, seriously injuring others. b) Further incidents on the escarpment road between Bukavu and Uvira; reportedly heavy artillery fire from across the Rwandan border directed on vehicles using the road; Zairian soldiers guarding the road return fire. 4. Tanzania a) New camp opened in Kibondo district (Mtendele camp) to accommodate new arrivals from Burundi. 5. Rwanda a) FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission Report released. Mission estimated 1996 food production 15 percent higher than 1995 production. Import requirements total 64,000 mt of which some 44,000 mt is required as food aid. A. EAST AFRICA 1: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA 1. REGIONAL 1.1 A mission with USAID Food for Peace and the US Embassy in Kampala with WFP participation completed its review of USAID assistance to the Great Lakes Region. The mission also met European Community regional representatives in Bujumbura to discuss common issues of interest under the Regional operation. 2. BURUNDI 2.1 Insecurity continues to be precarious throughout the country. In Rutovu commune of Bururi province, a grenade exploded in an elementary school on 9 July resulting in a reported six deaths and 17 injuries. Ambushes continue in Cibitoke. In Muramvya, rebels attacked a cheese factory and an attack on a military-escorted convoy led to one soldier killed and another wounded. 2.2 Due to new reports of violence, including recent deaths of some 50 persons, in the Kabezi area of Bujumbura rural, WFP received a request from the local parish for food assistance for 12,252 persons. WFP is assessing the situation. 2.3 The situation in Buhinyuza and Mwakiro communes in Muyinga province is very tense; many areas are completely empty of inhabitants. 2.4 Regular WFP operations are still on hold in the Gitega/ Karuzi area due to insecurity, and all staff remain in Bujumbura. No further requests have been made to WFP for food assistance in either Gitega or Karuzi following recent distributions in both areas. 2.5 The Burundian members of the Technical Committee, in charge of studying the criteria for an intervention force as per the recommendations of the Arusha summit, met on 16 July and are expected to issue the conclusions of their report to the National Security Council by 20 July. This report will later be submitted to the International Technical Committee, presided by Julius Nyerere. 2.6 Demonstrations continue in Bujumbura protesting the proposed deployment of an international intervention force in Burundi. On 15 July, there was a further protest march by university and high school students. 3. ZAIRE - GOMA 3.1 Security incidents in Goma town have diminished following new military order which forbids off-duty soldiers to carry guns. Serious security incidents in and around the camps have also fallen off. 3.2 Two WFP truck drivers were robbed at gunpoint on theaccess road to Goma port on Lake Kivu after their trucks were unloaded at the port. 3.3 The situation in the Masisi area is relatively calm. Villagers are continuing to return their home villages. However, the villagers are returning to destroyed and pillaged homes, all their livestock stolen or slaughtered, and fields neglected. Insecurity is still a problem in parts of the area, with incidents reported in Bitonga in the south and Mweso in the north. In Bitonga, a reported Hutu attack on Hunde villages lasted four days and resulted in 35 deaths and 3,000 displaced. 3.4 Firewood provision to the camps is improving with the gradual calming of the security situation in the region and the opening of the Goma-Butembo road. 3.5 The results of a nutritional survey in Kibumba camp have shown a significant improvement. The 8.3 percent of global malnutrition found in November 1995 fell to 3.5 percent in July 1996. A nutritional survey in the fifth and final camp took place on 15 July. Results should be available next reporting week. 3.6 From 8 to 14 July WFP Goma received a total of 2,993 mt of commodities. A total of 543 mt were dispatched to Bukavu. 4. ZAIRE - BUKAVU 4.1 A grenade exploded in Inera camp on 10 July killing a woman and a girl and seriously injuring several others. 4.2 On 12 July Zairian soldiers guarding the escarpment road which leads to Uvira returned fire on Rwanda after reportedly heavy artillery fire from across the border was directed on trucks and buses travelling the Zairian road. However this has not affected the delivery of relief food to Bukavu. 4.3 The general caseload for the Bukavu camps has been temporarily set at 294,978 beneficiaries. Verification of population figures goes ahead slowly in the camps. WFP Bukavu is monitoring the operation very closely to ensure the validity of the final figures. 4.4 Delivery of rations except for CSB completed in all camps except for Kabira and Nyamirangwe which were on stand-by for a verification of population figures and are scheduled for deliveries next week. CSB will be delivered to all camps once received. 4.5 Reception of food aid supplies almost doubled compared to previous week due to a continued increasing flow of food from the northern route and an increased capacity of WFP-leased trucks on the southern route from Uvira. 5. ZAIRE - UVIRA 5.1 Up to 500 refugees from the Cibitoke area have been fleeing to Uvira daily over the period 10-16 July. 5.2 Official refugee population in Uvira now totals 191,922 persons. This figure reflects the results of the census operation in all eleven camps as well as the recent arrival of some 6,000 new refugees. 6. TANZANIA 6.1 A new camp, called Mtendele, opened in Kibondo district to accommodate new arrivals from Burundi. The camp, which is located 2.5 km from the Kibondo-Nyakanazi road, has a current population of 288 refugees. A Tanzanian NGO will be responsible for food distribution and camp management, while the International Refugee Committee will cover health and sanitation services for refugees. 6.2 UNHCR, the Ministry of Home Affairs and NGOs are studying the possibility of opening a new camp in Kasulu district for the continuing flow of Burundian refugees into that area. 6.3 A total of 445 Burundian refugees arrived between 8 and 14 July and were registered at Mtabila and Kanembwa camps in the Kigoma region. 6.4 Total refugee population as at 14 July is 644,267. 7. RWANDA 7.1 FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission Report concluded and released. Similar to the findings of the preceding season, an increase of 7 percent was noted in the planted area. This reflects improved stability in the interior of Rwanda and resumption of regular agricultural activities by a considerable number of returning refugees. The Mission estimated the output of this season (1996 B) to be 181,000 mt (cereals and pulses). Import requirements total 64,000 mt ofwhich some 44,000 mt is required as food aid. Food production for the whole of 1996 is estimated to be 15 percent higher than in 1995 but still remains 23 percent below pre-crisis level in 1990. In terms of per capita production, considering the smaller number of people in 1996, this year's result is 14 percent below the 1990 level. 7.2 A WFP Management Review Mission is scheduled for September 1996. Issues to be reviewed will include level of assistance and overall programming matters. 7.3 During the past week high government officials (Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Interior and Agriculture Ministers and Parliament members) paid visits to Cyangugu, Gisenyi and Kibuye. Security and the refugee situation were the main items on the agenda. 7.4 Human rights agencies in Rwanda reported that the month of June witnessed a record increase in numbers of attacks on genocide survivors and witnesses. The total for 1996 is 98 attacks with at least 80 casualties. In Kibuye and Cyangugu, a move of survivors from imminent border areas deeper into the interior has been noticed as a consequence. The President of Rwanda has pledged that the Government will make new efforts to support and protect these vulnerable groups. 7.5 Caseload of the supplementary feeding programme for Masisi refugees is anticipated to rise from current 1,400 beneficiaries to around 2,000. WFP will continue to provide 1,000 food rations and CRS will supply the rest. 7.6 Zairian refugees continue to arrive to Gisenyi, though in much smaller numbers than before. 7.7 New refugees from Burundi also continue to arrive with some 500 persons registered between 9-15 July.

95,26927,[12033],Mine Action,Demining Country Report: Iraq,"Update 26 Feb 96 - Iraq said its civil defence teams defused tens of thousands of bombs the U.S.-led coalition forces dropped over the southern province of Muthanna during their 1991 campaign to eject Iraqi troops from Kuwait. Five years after the end of the Gulf War over Kuwait, Iraqi newspapers publish periodic reports of mines either killing or wounding civilians, shepards and animals. (Source: Reuter)  7 Feb 96 - On 6 February, 870 items of unexploded ordnance were marked in 45 locations across the DMZ. With high winds and rain shifting both ordnance and markers, the risk of ordnance-related injury has been reported to be significant. The critical shortage of ordnance disposal explosives continues to be major safety concern within UNIKOM. (Source: UN/DPKO) Overview SITUATION - Dec. 95 - This report is specifically related to the mines problem in North Iraq, in particular the area referred to as Kurdistan. Intelligence on the situation there comes primarily from the Mines Advisory Group (MAG), active in demining there since May 1992. MAG has thus far cleared 20,777 landmines, 959,600 sqm of land, and 87,296 pieces of UXO.  North Iraq is seriously impacted by mines and UXO. Rae McGrath, writing in Refugee Participation Network in Mar. 94, reported that grazing livestock, collecting water and firewood, and scavenging, are the most mine vulnerable activities in northern Iraq. ""Firewood collection is possibly the highest risk occupation for all age groups in a mined environment,"" he rote. ""A common scenario is when a mother with several young children takes them with her to cut firewood, either to assist her or because they are too young to be left alone. Children become casualties either while helping to collect or carry wood or, in the case of younger children, by straying off tracks while the mother, loaded with wood, is unable to control them."" He noted with concern the rise of a ""land mine culture,"" which is strikingly similar to the situation in Cambodia, where land mines are an accepted component of daily life.  ""Children, especially young boys, have been known to start mine collections and may use common mines to swap for rare ones."" McGrath noted that part of the problem lay with mine awareness instructors handing out fake mines in refugee camps as teaching aids, and letting them ""fall into the hands of refugee children as collectors' items.""  In northern Iraq ""the risk of mine-related death and injury is compounded as resettlement and agricultural activity gather pace - the rehabilitation of the agricultural sector being essential to attaining long-term economic self-sufficiency (some 17% of arable land is under mines,"" reports the UN. In the border region, 50% of agricultural land can not be used. In the governate of Sulaimania 40% of land is uncultivated because of mines.  Casualties MAG's database has figures for casualties, compiled from major hospitals in the three governates of Suleimaniya, Erbil and Dohuk. The figures do not include unreported injuries and deaths occurring in more remote areas. Since 1991, according to hospital records, 2,126 people died, of which over 65% were male in all governates, with children making up the bulk of the remainder (minimum of 20% in the three governates). There were 3,651 injuries.  MAG reports that gathering wood, herding animals and smuggling are the most high risk activities. Chwarta has the highest injury figures in the governate of Suleimaniya with 672, compared to 647 in Penjwin and 424 in Halabja. These injury figures do not include mine or UXO deaths.  Handicap International reported that of the amputations performed by its surgeons between 16 Nov. 91 to 9 Feb. 92, 48.8% (408) were below the knee, and 16.7% (140) were above the knee. Also, ""about 30% of injuries die before reaching hospital from bleeding or abdominal injuries. Most of the rest are amputees."" Out of 810 casualties that resulted in handicaps, 59.2% (480) were caused by land mines, whereas only 7.1% (58) were caused by bullets. 728 were men and 82 were women.  Locations March 1996  The total number of minefields demarcated between March 1993 and October 1995 is 121 or 1,880,868 msq. In 1996, Mine Advisory Group (MAG) will be investigating how demarcation and minefield survey can be more closely linked with the community education programme. This will enhance the impact of the mine awareness messages as well as providing a practical response until such time as clearance can begin. Demarcation teams will have to expand accordingly. (Source: MAG)  The borders with Kuwait, Iran, Syria and Turkey are severely mined.  Disaster Aid Center/UK reports that there are 2.5 million mines in the governate of Dohuk. Save the Children estimates the figure to be near the 5 million mark.  Minefields: Areas in Erbil Governate already clearly marked to indicate mines include Sardekan Hill, Azadi, Derband, Nawpradan, Konyarasukosa, Shik Mowlan/Kandinowberger, Sirmin/Sinan, and Kandibokidera. Starting in the south, from the marshes towards the north, the main minefields in the north are: Khanaquin, Derbendikhan, Qaradagh, Halabja, Sherezor, Penjwin, Shanazeh, Merve, Qala Sholan, Mawat, Pijschder, Balisan, Haj Omran, Choman, Sidakan, Mirga Zor, barzan and Zakho Sahela.  Number of Mines The UN estimate for Iraq is 10 million.  Country Statistics Existing mines:  AT 2,000,000  AP 8,000,000  total 10,000,000 Cleared mines:  AT  AP  total 20,777 UXO Cleared: 87,296 Land Cleared: 1,880,868 Demining Capacity MAG is demining in the north:  MAG Surveying: Between Mar. 93-Oct. 95, 121 minefields (1,880,868 msq) were demarcated, of which 32 minefields were completely cleared.  There are four demarcation teams working, with four more being trained. They have surveyed 1216 minefields (Aug. 95). MAG reports that of these, 497 are Priority 1 tasks and 719 Priority 2. It takes the surveyers about 2 weeks to demark an average size minefield of 20,000 msq. Doubling the four teams means it should take 6-7 years to demarcate P1 and P2 minefields. MAG also believes, however, that there are a further 700 minefields to be surveyed, of which 450 will be P1 or P2.  MAG Demining: There are over 200 technical/disposal national staff, supplemented by five expatriate mine specialists and one explosive ordnance disposal expert. The seven demining teams and four EOD teams are working from five bases of operation. These are: Choman, Diyuna (site of the training camp), Halabja, Penjwin and Chwarta. MAG responds to local and NGO requests for mine and UXO clearance. The newest operation base in Chwarta, established Sep. 95, is approximately 1600 km sq, of which 17 km sq of 70 kms of agricultural land is mined.  MAG Mine Awareness: By Mar. 94 all villages in the governate of Suleimaniya had been reached by community mine awareness field officers (they have been in field since Sep. 92). People are taught to distinguish between mines and minefields with puppet shows, plays, songs, posters and videos. A schools programme runs through the Oct.-May school year.  Background Mine laying in northern Iraq began in the 1960s and continued throughout the 1970s in an effort by the central government to subdue Kurdish separatists. During the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran War, the north was mined for strategic purposes. ""Iraqi mine laying in their northern provinces was targeted both at the one-time Iranian foe and the local Kurdish population, whose lands and villages were thus made uninhabitable,"" writes Michael Griffin in Ceres. Mines were planted in irrigation ditches, grape or watermelon plantations, pasture land and forest margins.  According to one Iraqi sapper commander, his 20-man section laid between 80-100,000 AP and AT devices in the Zakho region, working flat-out over a 20-day period shortly after the invasion of Kuwait. There were 120 sections working simultaneously in the same area, reported Griffin. Another report has a team of military engineers laying 4-5,000 mines per day just below the earth's surface along the border with Iran. Many mines have a life-span of 45 years. It is estimated that a 120 strong company of army engineers could take 12 hours to lay 5,000 mines in one sq km. Millions of land mines were sown in southern Iraq during the Gulf War. Millions more were sown in Kurdistan during the Kurdish uprising which followed. And still more were left by Turkish Army units which entered Iraq in 1995 in hot pursuit of Kurdish rebels.  Mine notes The most common mines identified in Iraq are the Valmara 69 and the VS-50. They are manufactured by Italian arms manufacturer Valseall Meccanotecnica SPA of Brescis. Because of bans on doing business with Iraq, the company set up a new company in Singapore to obtain a trade and manufacturer's licence. Chartered Industries of Singapore, whose government has a stake in the company, produces identical mines to Valsella.  There are three types of minefields in Iraq:  1) Regular Minefields: Laid to ward off army attacks, they were laid in a pattern until 1987, when they were laid randomly. There are many Iranian regular minefields laid in southern Iraq.  2) Irregular Minefields: These were planted by engineers to channel population flows out of rebel territory. and disrupt community living. Farms, orchards and waterways were mined.  3) Military Defensive Minefields: Mines were laid to protect military checkpoints and installations.

Five years after the end of the Gulf War over Kuwait, Iraqi newspapers publish periodic reports of mines either killing or wounding civilians, shepards and animals. (Source: Reuter)  7 Feb 96 - On 6 February, 870 items of unexploded ordnance were marked in 45 locations across the DMZ. With high winds and rain shifting both ordnance and markers, the risk of ordnance-related injury has been reported to be significant. The critical shortage of ordnance disposal explosives continues to be major safety concern within UNIKOM. (Source: UN/DPKO) Overview SITUATION - Dec. 95 - This report is specifically related to the mines problem in North Iraq, in particular the area referred to as Kurdistan. Intelligence on the situation there comes primarily from the Mines Advisory Group (MAG), active in demining there since May 1992. MAG has thus far cleared 20,777 landmines, 959,600 sqm of land, and 87,296 pieces of UXO.  North Iraq is seriously impacted by mines and UXO. Rae McGrath, writing in Refugee Participation Network in Mar. 94, reported that grazing livestock, collecting water and firewood, and scavenging, are the most mine vulnerable activities in northern Iraq. ""Firewood collection is possibly the highest risk occupation for all age groups in a mined environment,"" he rote. ""A common scenario is when a mother with several young children takes them with her to cut firewood, either to assist her or because they are too young to be left alone. Children become casualties either while helping to collect or carry wood or, in the case of younger children, by straying off tracks while the mother, loaded with wood, is unable to control them."" He noted with concern the rise of a ""land mine culture,"" which is strikingly similar to the situation in Cambodia, where land mines are an accepted component of daily life.  ""Children, especially young boys, have been known to start mine collections and may use common mines to swap for rare ones."" McGrath noted that part of the problem lay with mine awareness instructors handing out fake mines in refugee camps as teaching aids, and letting them ""fall into the hands of refugee children as collectors' items.""  In northern Iraq ""the risk of mine-related death and injury is compounded as resettlement and agricultural activity gather pace - the rehabilitation of the agricultural sector being essential to attaining long-term economic self-sufficiency (some 17% of arable land is under mines,"" reports the UN. In the border region, 50% of agricultural land can not be used. In the governate of Sulaimania 40% of land is uncultivated because of mines.  Casualties MAG's database has figures for casualties, compiled from major hospitals in the three governates of Suleimaniya, Erbil and Dohuk. The figures do not include unreported injuries and deaths occurring in more remote areas. Since 1991, according to hospital records, 2,126 people died, of which over 65% were male in all governates, with children making up the bulk of the remainder (minimum of 20% in the three governates). There were 3,651 injuries.  MAG reports that gathering wood, herding animals and smuggling are the most high risk activities. Chwarta has the highest injury figures in the governate of Suleimaniya with 672, compared to 647 in Penjwin and 424 in Halabja. These injury figures do not include mine or UXO deaths.  Handicap International reported that of the amputations performed by its surgeons between 16 Nov. 91 to 9 Feb. 92, 48.8% (408) were below the knee, and 16.7% (140) were above the knee. Also, ""about 30% of injuries die before reaching hospital from bleeding or abdominal injuries. Most of the rest are amputees."" Out of 810 casualties that resulted in handicaps, 59.2% (480) were caused by land mines, whereas only 7.1% (58) were caused by bullets. 728 were men and 82 were women.  Locations March 1996  The total number of minefields demarcated between March 1993 and October 1995 is 121 or 1,880,868 msq. In 1996, Mine Advisory Group (MAG) will be investigating how demarcation and minefield survey can be more closely linked with the community education programme. This will enhance the impact of the mine awareness messages as well as providing a practical response until such time as clearance can begin. Demarcation teams will have to expand accordingly. (Source: MAG)  The borders with Kuwait, Iran, Syria and Turkey are severely mined.  Disaster Aid Center/UK reports that there are 2.5 million mines in the governate of Dohuk. Save the Children estimates the figure to be near the 5 million mark.  Minefields: Areas in Erbil Governate already clearly marked to indicate mines include Sardekan Hill, Azadi, Derband, Nawpradan, Konyarasukosa, Shik Mowlan/Kandinowberger, Sirmin/Sinan, and Kandibokidera. Starting in the south, from the marshes towards the north, the main minefields in the north are: Khanaquin, Derbendikhan, Qaradagh, Halabja, Sherezor, Penjwin, Shanazeh, Merve, Qala Sholan, Mawat, Pijschder, Balisan, Haj Omran, Choman, Sidakan, Mirga Zor, barzan and Zakho Sahela.  Number of Mines The UN estimate for Iraq is 10 million.  Country Statistics Existing mines:  AT 2,000,000  AP 8,000,000  total 10,000,000 Cleared mines:  AT  AP  total 20,777 UXO Cleared: 87,296 Land Cleared: 1,880,868 Demining Capacity MAG is demining in the north:  MAG Surveying: Between Mar. 93-Oct. 95, 121 minefields (1,880,868 msq) were demarcated, of which 32 minefields were completely cleared.  There are four demarcation teams working, with four more being trained. They have surveyed 1216 minefields (Aug. 95). MAG reports that of these, 497 are Priority 1 tasks and 719 Priority 2. It takes the surveyers about 2 weeks to demark an average size minefield of 20,000 msq. Doubling the four teams means it should take 6-7 years to demarcate P1 and P2 minefields. MAG also believes, however, that there are a further 700 minefields to be surveyed, of which 450 will be P1 or P2.  MAG Demining: There are over 200 technical/disposal national staff, supplemented by five expatriate mine specialists and one explosive ordnance disposal expert. The seven demining teams and four EOD teams are working from five bases of operation. These are: Choman, Diyuna (site of the training camp), Halabja, Penjwin and Chwarta.

96,26930,[4599],Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,Chechen Town's Survivors Live Amid Ashes and Rubble of Russian Attacks,"By David Hoffman SAMASHKI, Russia -- In Moscow's brutal war against Chechen separatists, this is ground zero. The green metal fences are lacerated with bullet and shrapnel holes. Many rooftops are nothing more than skeletons. In the main market, women peddling vegetables keep a Russian artillery shell casing perched on the street in front of their stalls. Children climb recklessly on the glass-splattered, bombed-out building once known in the Soviet era as the House of Culture but now just a testament to the ruins of war. While other villages and towns have also been devastated in the 20-month-old Chechen conflict, few have surpassed the suffering of Samashki, a town of 12,000 people about 30 miles west of Grozny, the capital. It was here in April 1995 that drunken Russian soldiers went on a rampage, throwing grenades into cellars filled with women and children, killing more than 100 civilians. The killings prompted many protests by Russians opposed to the war, with some comparing it to the massacre by U.S. troops of Vietnamese civilians at My Lai. But it was not the end of Samashki's troubles. This year, in March, the town was hit again. According to residents, they had been given an ultimatum by Russian troops to cough up money and guns. But after they turned over three carloads of weapons, the Russians gave residents an abrupt warning to flee, then attacked the town again, in some cases leveling homes only recently rebuilt from the first assault. It was part of a larger, fierce offensive against Chechen separatist rebels that was launched just before President Boris Yeltsin announced a peace initiative on March 31. ""We don't plan to rebuild until the Russian army leaves,"" said Arbiyya Shansayev, 35, an agronomist, whose brother was slain in the first massacre. ""Right now, we're just living a life of subsistence."" Even taking into account the relatively primitive state of rural communities in Russia's outlying regions, Samashki is barely surviving. Once there was electricity, water and natural gas here. Now there is little of anything. Mounds of rubble, broken glass and bricks line the streets. A donkey-drawn cart brings water by the pail. A hammer echoes in the distance as one family struggles to make a house habitable again. ""You have to build some huts, at least,"" Shansayev said. As many as 15 people live in each of the houses still standing. But many of those who escaped last year's massacre have not escaped the destitution and despair that befall civilians caught in the throes of war. Asat Salgireva, 52, survived both attacks but lives amid the ashes of two homes -- both on the same site, both destroyed by Russian artillery shells. Now she occupies a tent along with six grandchildren, a son, two daughters and three elderly family members. Pots and pans lie on the dirt floor, and a jury-rigged pipe occasionally emits enough natural gas to cook a hot meal. Family members sell tomatoes and canned goods at the bazaar, hoping to earn the equivalent of 50 cents a day to survive. ""I don't know how we'll manage in the winter,"" she said. ""We'll have to ask people to take us in."" Behind the tent is a small truck garden, but she said they are afraid to eat the vegetables, fearing they have been somehow contaminated by the Russian bombardments. The front of the tent is a wasteland of ash and the remnants of her second house. A naked stovepipe protrudes into the air; a bathtub sits by a radiator. But the house, a prefabricated one brought to the town after the first attack, was demolished in the second. Mayerbeck Musayev, 52, who was born in Kazakhstan when Chechens were living there in exile by order of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, was sitting on a nearly crushed building across the street from his wrecked home. He had put a corrugated metal roof on it ""in order to survive the winter,"" he said. ""But until the [Russian troops] leave, nothing else will be done."" ""We are now eating our last grains of salt,"" he said, as young children raced toward the water cart with empty pails. The trials of Samashki offer an illustration of how civilians have been drawn into the vortex of this war between the light-footed Chechen rebels and the clumsy but heavily armed Russians. Chechen towns and villages are home for many of the guerrillas, and their lives are woven into those of civilians. The Russian forces, mostly Internal Affairs Ministry troops, are on unfamiliar, hostile territory. In fighting the rebels, the Russians have killed civilians by the thousands; more than 30,000 people have died here, most of them civilians caught in Russian onslaughts. The Samashki massacre occurred while Russian troops were purportedly searching for a few elusive guerrillas. After the killings, Russian authorities classified all the dead as ""fighters,"" but they were not. The massacre was later exhaustively documented in a report prepared by the Memorial Human Rights Center in Moscow. In interviews with witnesses, rights center investigators confirmed that the killings took place on April 7-8, 1995, after Russian troops had clashed with a small group of Chechen rebels near the village. Following the skirmish, the report said, Internal Affairs troops and riot police ""began an operation to mop up the village,"" described as ""an intense search of the streets, house-by-house, to find, neutralize or detain rebel fighters in hiding and also to seize arms caches."" But the victims of this ""mop-up"" operation were almost entirely civilians, according to the Moscow center, which documented the deaths of 103 people in what it said was an incomplete tally. According to the report, the villagers were killed by ""shelling, strafing of streets from armored vehicles, sniper fire on streets and in courtyards, execution-style shootings in houses and yards; grenades thrown into and exploded in cellars, yards and rooms with people present; the burning of houses, murders committed while detained people were being marched off."" Moreover, the report found, many of wounded villagers died because the troops refused to allow ""timely, decent medical help"" to reach them. Shakhid Adulyev, 64, a Samashki pensioner who survived the massacre, recalled that the Russian devastation of Grozny ""was bad, but this is worse. What they did to us here is something you shouldn't do to livestock."" =A9 Copyright 1996 The Washington Post Company","Chechen Town's Survivors Live Amid Ashes and Rubble of Russian Attacks By David Hoffman SAMASHKI, Russia -- In Moscow's brutal war against Chechen separatists, this is ground zero.

Two UN peacekeepers were killed on the road, between Saurimo and Luena, on 27 July when their vehicle hit a landmine.  On 1 August, another landmine was found on the same road and on 10 August a UN convoy carrying 85 UNITA soldiers, as well as 25 women and 38 children, hit a 130mm artillery shell with a detonator on top. Twenty-five UNITA soldiers were hurt. (Source: Reuter)  2 July 96 - The UN reported that a group of peace-keepers from Namibia were detained by UNITA soldiers in the diamond-rich Lunda Norte area at Xinge, on the road between the cities of Malange and Saurimo. The road was recently de-mined by South Africa's Mechem company so UNITA soldiers could be disarmed at an assembly camp to be setup along the road. (Source: Reuter)  2 April 96 - Mr. Kotsoi, senior official in the office of the President of South Africa, discussed with the Special Representative  of the Secretary-General (UN) to Angola the on-going peace process including South Africa's support for the demining programme and logistical assistance to the quartering facilities. (Source: UN/DPKO)  18 March 96 - Demobilised soldiers from Angola's army and the opposition UNITA movement, who were fighting each other before a peace accord two years ago, are now swapping war stories and learning how to clear mines. At the demining school in Viana, the Angolan Government's demining school (INAROE), demobilized UNITA and FAA soldiers are taught how to detect and clear mines under the watchful eye of UN instructors from Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Pakistan.

These new weapon shipments are seen as undermining the demobilization and demilitarization efforts which as the core of the peace process.  Human Rights Watch indicates that finding weapons backer is difficult since ""some of the shipments to UNITA have gone through surreptitious routes"". This has been exacerbated by the maintenance of mercenaries by both sides. One South African-based frim . Executive Outcomes (EO) has been employed by both sides to provide security and training. Although Angolan President Dos Santos has stated that EO's contract has been cancelled and all its personnel are out of the country, Human Rights Watch argues that the firm might be using several front companies to carry out contracts.

(Source: HEWS)  12 Dec. 95 - Responding to criticism that the UN peacekeeping operation in Angola was stalled, the Secretary-General remarked: ""Many of the factors that prevented implementation of the earlier peace accords are still very much in evidence - distrust, continuing military activities, foot-dragging over quartering and related activities, obstruction of free movement and the restoration of government administration, lack of respect for the UN and other international personnel."" The UN has been unable to start its preliminary mine clearance operations, which must proceed before its forces can be fully deployed.  Overview SITUATION  Dec 95 - ""The whole of Angola must be considered a mined area."" That comment, made by a South African brigadier, sums up the dismal land mine situation in Angola. For three decades land mines have been used to devastating effect by a wide array of groups. ""The scope and complexity of the mine threat is probably greater than in any other country and will require a well-coordinated approach,"" notes the Executive Summary of the UN Mine Action Programme for Angola.  Roads, waterways, railroads, airports, ports, towns and private dwellings were mined in a scorched earth conflict that meant to deny the enemy land and resources that could not be held by army personnel. Bridges were mined to prevent saboteurs from attacking them; they were mined again after destruction to prevent repair work. Soldiers in retreat on both sides during the 1992 strife are reported to have mined schools, hospitals and markets.  Food supplies have been seriously affected by mines. People trapped in beseiged cities were forced to venture into mine infested areas to get to food. The 200,000 strong town of Luena, ringed by defensive minefields, is almost completely dependent on WFP food aid because the minefields have reduced the amount of land available for sustainable agriculture.  Repatriation of some 250,000 refugees from abroad, and resettlement of one million displaced persons inside Angola, is an essential part of the peace process. But the 9-15 million land mines threaten to derail peaceful repatriation and will ensure that Angola remains an economic basketcase for years to come. The mine menace poses an immediate threat to the in-coming UNAVEM III peace-keepers, mandated to hold the peace and begin a massive national reconstruction effort. The re-establishment of regional governments, and plans to hold elections may be dependent on mine clearance.  Casualties The UN estimates that 1.5% of the population has been injured in mine or UXO incidents. An ICRC survey in 1990 determined that 69% of the injured were walking on paths at the time of the blast, 15% on roads, and 16% in inhabitated areas. Angola has the highest number of amputees in the world, estimated at 70,000 in the UN's 1995 Angola Appeal. The ICRC has a rehabilitation center in Bomba Alto, where 11 staff manufacture prosthesis. Between Jan-Nov. 90, 631 new patients were fitted with prosthesis at the center, and a total of 1,127 prostheses were manufactured there for the year.  Locations The following data was provided by Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation (VVAF):  Bie Province: Severely mined. Movement is restricted by mines and the town of Kuito has been mined and remined, often with booby-traps.  Kuando Kubango Province: Severely mined. The Mavingo Valley is abandoned because of mines. In Cuito Cuanavale only 8,000 out of 33,000 planted mines have been identified.  Lunda Norte Province: Severely mined. All roads, bridges and riverbanks are considered mined.  Lunda Sul Province: Severely mined. Thirty major or strategic bridges, and 58 secondary bridges, are deswtroyed and most are surrounded by uncleared minefields.  Malanje Province: Severely mined.

Moxico Province: Severely mined. The town of Luena is encircled by mines and most roads are mined.  Zaire Province: Mined. Demining operations were carried out in 1991 along major roads, though some are still mined. Border posts at M'banza Kongo-Luvo, Noqui and Beu-Fiscak are mined.

Background The end of the Cold War did not restore peace or order to this mineral rich country located in south-west Africa. Angola is 1,246,700 sq kms in area, bordered by Namibia, Zaire, Zambia and Congo. The capital city is Luanda. There are 18 provinces. The estimated population of 12,178,000 is matched by the presence of an estimated 9-15 million landmines.  The sowing of mines began in the 1960s when Portugal bitterly resisted anti-colonial movements, of which the most important were MPLA (Popular Front for the Liberation of Angola), led by Jose Eduardo Santos, and UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), led by Jonas Savimbi. The end of Portugese rule in 1975 was followed by economic collapse, civil war and military intervention by the super-powers and regional neighbors, all with an eye on Angola's extensive oil and mineral reserves.  ""While Portugese, Cuban and South African forces are known to have deployed landmines during operations in Angola, the overwhelming responsibility for landmines use lies with UNITA and the Angolan Army (FAPLA),"" report authors Roberts and Williams in After the Guns Fall Silent: The Enduring Legacy of Landmines.  Africa Watch reports that mines were an integral part of UNITA's hit-and-run war strategy: ""At one time or another, almost every part of the country was affected, as the foci of battle rapidly shifted backwards and forwards. Because of this mobility, the disruption of land communications was a major aim of UNITA, and the mining of roads, paths and bridges was consequently an important strategy."" The rebels also preferred to deploy anti-handling devices, and laid mines at random, unmarked.  In Lisbon, on 31 May 91, peace accords were signed between the MPLA and UNITA leaders as famine stalked the countryside. National elections were held under UN supervision between 29-30 Sep. 92. UNITA refused to concede defeat to the MPLA. The peace process was scuttled and war resumed.  Over the next two years, much of Angola was ruined. Over 3 million people were left dependent on food aid or humanitarian assistance. In Mar. 93 the Security Council authorized the creation of the Humanitarian Assistance Cooperation Unit (UCAH) to coordinate aid relief. On 20 Nov. 94 the Lusaka Protocol was signed, allowing for a ceasefire. UNITA accepted the election results and the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNIVEM III) began one of the most ambitious humanitarian intervention operations in history.  Mine notes Relief workers estimate there to be 34 types of landmines in Angola. There are many Russian-made mines, including the TMN-46, PMD-7-TS, M-19, PP-MI-SP, and the POMZ-2 anti-personnel mine. Activated by a tripwire, the POMZ-2 is stake mounted; rotting stakes pose a special hazard for deminers. The American M-18A1 mine has been found in Angola; with a kill radius of 50 meters, it releases 700 steel balls to cause maximum damage. The TMA-3, made in Yugoslavia, is an anti-tank mine that is non-detectable with hand-held metallic detectors (there is no metallic content in the mine fuse or body).

The reporting period saw the arrival of Jim O'Neill as the new UNDHA Humanitarian Affairs Office in Baku as well as Ms. Ann Howarth-Wiles as the Head of UNHCR Liaison Office-Baku. OVERALL HUMANITARIAN SITUATION Uncertainty in regards to project funding for the various International and National Organisations continues to be the most pressing issue faced in the humanitarian sector. ECHO has revealed that they will shortly begin phasing out of emergency funding activities and by April 1997 could be ready to hand over the task of development project funding to TASCIS. Funding difficulties are especially pertinent in the shelter sector as winter rapidly approaches and only minimal winterization projects are presently being carried out. It is feared that the vulnerable population will once again suffer a long and difficult winter. The involved agencies, UNHCR, Relief International (RI), International Rescue Committee (IRC), CARE and Hayat are performing exceptionally well in their construction and rehabilitation programmes but more and timely funding will be required in order to adequately improve the situation. With the previously mentioned funding cutbacks, several International Agencies will be completing various projects at the end of October, and presently are unclear on their future presence in Azerbaijan. Much anticipation is being given to the recent USAID strategy team visit and the possible funding outcome of their assessments. The issue of the Ex-Turkish camps has also become a concern. The deteriorating state of tents as well as the overall camp management has resulted in a series of requests from the Government of Armenia (GoA) to all International Organisations for assistance. DHA made a site visit to these two camps on 24 September, and found them to be managing reasonably well, albeit, at a reduced level. CARE (Agcabedi) and World Vision(Barda) have assumed the responsibility of the food distribution and have begun a re-registration of the camp residents in order to try and eliminate well documented instances of fraud in the distribution of humanitarian assistance at both camps. Food distributions are scheduled to occur in early October. As far as the camps health situation, RI will send their mobile health clinic, on a bi- monthly basis to the camps. SECTORS FOOD AID Owing to the lack of resources, most agencies will be scaling down their food assistance programmes in the near future, while attempting to target their aid at more defined vulnerable groups. WFP has an adequate food supply, both in country and in the pipeline, to carry out their projects and those of their implementing partners until June 1997. WFP initiated a revised distribution method, adopted by the relevant agencies , which concentrates on ""food per person"" as opposed to the previous distribution of ""family parcels"". It is felt that by distributing in this manner, food aid will be more controlled and target beneficiaries will be better met as well as saving considerable amounts of food which may have wound up in the market. The GoA, has declared in a decree made in August, 1996 that use of the ration card, commonly referred to as form ""No. 9"", will no longer be accepted for receiving humanitarian assistance. This form was originally used as a replacement for those citizens who had lost their passports while fleeing the conflict areas. The government rightfully feels, that the misuse and duplication of this card has contributed to the negative international response to the needs of Azerbaijan, and is attempting to make the receiving of humanitarian assistance more controllable. In its place a ""new"" and improved form No. 9"" will be issued. The initial ""new forms"" were made with thin paper. WFP feels that forms printed on this paper could be easily duplicated and has offered to provide a thicker, cardboard-type paper for its printing. It has been decided that the cardboard forms would be used uniquely in food distribution, while the thin-paper forms would be used for obtaining other types of assistance. One of the major problems encountered with the form change is that clear and concise information concerning the usage has not yet been initiated by the Government and relayed to the outlying areas. WFP continues to emphasize the need for a country-wide registration of IDPs/refugees in order to support the computerization of these figures which has already begun in some regions. The IFRC has launched a programme that will provide food items to 7,000 patients in more than 80 hospitals in Azerbaijan. HEALTH Several agencies are beginning to become involved in the reproductive health field. Most initial activities will be small scale and at selected regions. They will be geared to both IDPs and general populations. Meetings have occurred with these agencies in order to share resources and discuss future programmes. A WHO consultant visited Azerbaijan in September to assist in the establishment of family planning and reproductive health programmes in Ganja and Sumgayit. The consultant conducted a workshop in these towns to familiarize gynecologists with modern methods of family planning. August saw a major restructuring in the Ministry of Health (MoH). There was a considerable reduction in MoH staff and several Departments were integrated, notably the SES and the Epidemiological Department merged to form one countrywide unit. The MoH stress that these moves are more related to economical reasons rather a major Health Reform. There is a plan for a further reduction, estimated at 30-40 percent in staff cuts and the closure of up to 70,000 hospital beds. While there are still no private medical institutions in Azerbaijan, the MoH has established a system of ""payment for services"" in the hospitals. Full implementation of these charges has not yet been finalized. Owing to timely intervention by IFRC and MSF-Holland, malaria cases have decreased. In August, 839 cases were reported, considerably lower than in June and July. The MoH reports that up to 10,000 cases, mostly in the IDP camps of Imishli, Bilasuvar, and Sabirabad have been registered this year. Outbreaks of Anthrax, an acute bacterial infection that occurs most frequently in herbivorous animals, have been reported in Azerbaijan. Sales of lamb were suspended in several regions, especially in Agcabedi and Imishli, the principle areas for sheep production. A campaign to vaccinate the most ""at risk"", was conducted by the MoH. These would include butchers, wool handlers, and others involved in this occupation. No cases of Polio have been registered this year in Azerbaijan, evidence of UNICEF's successful MECACAR campaign. In 1993 there were 69 cases, 16 in 1994, and 5 in 1995. UNICEF and the MoH will conduct a country wide diphtheria immunization campaign during the month of October. The target group of approximately 4.5 million, will include children and adults. The findings of a joint UNICEF/WHO investigation revealed an increase of chronic exhaustion in children and the elderly as well as a high level, (20 percent), of iodine deficiency. As a result, a two year project on the development of health and nutrition systems in Azerbaijan will began in September. ICRC will continue to operate its orthopaedic centre first opened in 1995. Despite an ongoing cease fire, the number of mine related incidents are rising in the front line areas. SHELTER/NON-FOOD The focus in the shelter sector continues to be on those families living in the most extreme conditions, i.e. rail wagons, tents and dugouts. In addition, the arrival of colder weather helps to illustrate the need for improvements and/or winterization of public buildings, although difficulties in project funding have suspended or downsized many projects. The UNHCR funded, single-dwelling limestone shelter construction project continues to operate, but often, due to funding problems, work is delayed. Despite the delays, August saw the completion of 92 dwellings with an additional 171 started, for a cumulative total of 256 completed dwellings. RI, the main implementing partner for UNHCR in limestone shelter construction, will be finishing in October, construction of 150 houses in Saatly for railway wagon IDPs. Hayat, a local NGO, has completed 40 limestone units in Saatly designated for families living in extremely difficult conditions in the dug-outs. IRC has negotiated contracts and procured materials for up to 800 mud brick shelters. They will build 50 of these for families in the worse conditions at the ex-Turkish camp in Agcabedi following agreements with the camps administer, the Executive Committee of Agcabedi. CARE is also on schedule with their mud-brick shelter programme, with 1,100 out of a target number of 1,200, dwellings nearing completion. Public Building Rehabilitation (PBR) is being carried out by several organisations throughout the country. These projects range from rehabilitation of water and sanitary systems in medical facilities and children institutions, repair of school buildings, construction of partitions in rail way wagons housing IDP families, and the traditional PBR work in large structures housing IDPs. The GoA, reluctant initially, to approve PBR projects in Baku or Sumgaiyt, have relaxed their position and have begun to back projects in these areas. INCOME GENERATION There is a growing interest among the agencies in Income Generation projects (IG). Projects as diverse as sheep raising, distribution of small business kits, women sewing collectives, small business loans/grants, and greenhouses or other small scale agriculture projects are only a few of the areas covered. There is a tendency by some agencies to try and incorporate with shelter programmes, an idea of ""community building"" via IG projects in their various settlements. One of the more notable IG projects has been the IFRC's IDP ""construction team"". After gaining experience with construction activities in the camps, several work crews have emerged and have obtained building contracts in UNHCR and ECHO shelter projects. Another successful IFRC project has been selling vegetables grown by IDPs to the Hyatt Regency Hotel. ICRC has received 900 hectares in the Fizuli area project designed to sow and subsequently harvest 800-1000 MTs of wheat. Of this total, 400 MTs will be returned to the ICRC for distribution to vulnerable in the near by front- line region. Next year they intend to also grow vegetables and potatoes. TACIS has opened an office in Sabirabad where NGOs and any individuals can obtain advice in the different ways of income generation. It is anticipated that one of the best ways to bridge the transition process of relief to development will be in the creation of more IG projects. In order to inform the population about the various projects and to provide an opportunity to see finished products, the GoA in collaboration with NGOs is to hold an exhibition sometime in mid- October. CONTACTS DHA made introductory visits to all of the UN Agencies and most of the International and National Agencies in September. In addition a visits was also made to the office of Mr. Izzat Rustamov, Deputy Prime Minister in charge of International Humanitarian Assistance. October will bring about additional and more detailed discussions with the organisations, both Baku and field based. CONTRIBUTIONS As of the end of September, the DHA office in Azerbaijan has been informed of contributions of US$ 8,343,841 representing 31.2 percent of the total requested, US$ 32,966,638, in the 1996/97 Consolidated Appeal. ANNEX: RECENT GENERAL DEVELOPMENTS HUMANITARIAN AID A visit from 5 US Congressmen in August stir emotions for increased US assistance in Azerbaijan in 1997. The Congressmen passed an appeal to members of the sub-committee on Foreign Operations in the support for the draft of legislation for the funding for humanitarian assistance to Azerbaijan by NGOs and private volunteer organisations for 1997. American Oil Company (AMOCO) and ""AMERICARES"" have provided medical supplies (Kidney dialysis equipment) to the Oilmans hospital in Baku. Previously the same two have provided assistance in immunization programmes (Nakhchivan) and medical supplies for children in camps. The Russian oil company, LUKoil, has established a philanthropic society within their organisation. It will provide assistance mainly, but not exclusively to Russian citizens residing in Azerbaijan. In addition, assistance will be provided to the Orthodox Church, Slav Family, and to the individual needy citizens. They have delivered stockings to an elderly home and plan on assisting war invalids in the future. The Ministry of Social Welfare has announced that there are 1,200,000 pensioners and 250,000 invalids in Azerbaijan. AGRICULTURE 60 hectares of sugar beet seed have been planted in 5 regions of Azerbaijan for the first time. It is estimated that next August harvest will yield 60 MTs, enough to cover the current need. Harvesting of sugar beet began in September. It is hoped that the yield will be 40,000 MTs. This will be the fifth harvest of sugar beets in Azerbaijan. The crop is growing at a steady rate from the initial season, in 1992 with a net harvest of 16.400 MTs. 128,100 MTs of cotton have been picked thus far in Azerbaijan. The state order is for 310,000 MTs. Many IDPS are involved in this harvest earning 300 manats per kilo. According to the Ministry of Bread Products, Azerbaijan has purchased 257,000 MTs of grain this year, with 179,000 MTs being wheat and 77,000 MTs of barley. This is an increase of 22,000 MTs over last year. The Ministry claims it requires a minimum of 1.1 million MTs of grain per year. Preparations for the autumn sowing is continuing, 635,000 hectares (520,000 for wheat and 115,000 of barley) will be planted. On 26 August, the price of bread and all bread products increased by 100 Manats. This follows a 20 percent increase in July. In 1996, each month has seen a rise in price. The projected mixed vegetable harvest this year is 150,000 MTs. This includes 45,000 MTs of tomatoes, 5,000 MTs of cabbage, and 3,650 MTs of onions. Thus far 56,000 MTs or 37 percent of the projection have been harvested. The Minister of Agriculture, stated that of the total areas of land in the Republic, 8,641,000 hectares, 3,864,000 (45 percent) hectares will remain in Government hands, while 2,866,000 (33 percent) hectares will be transferred to municipal property and the remaining 1,911,000 (22 percent) will be privatized. A list of 3.8 million people who will be eligible to receive these private lands has been compiled. The arid summer has affected the quantity and quality of nut production. Mostly grown in the northern regions, an area of 16,895 hectares is usually planted. Last years yield was 10,336 MTs and this years it was expected to be close to 11,700 MTs, but the Ministry of Agriculture (MoAG) predicts a sharp decrease in the yield owing to the arid summer. As of mid-September, 48,000 MTs of grapes have been harvested. This figure represents 32 percent of the planned yield. Azeri scientists have announced they have developed a new type of pomegranate. It is more resistant, has a larger yield capacity, and contains 6 percent more sugar content than ordinary ones. PRIVATIZATION A World Bank Mission visited Azerbaijan with the goal of speeding up their 20 million Dollar project of establishing five pilot farmer economies, by reorganising the collective and state farms of the Uchar, Barda, Lenkoran, Salyan, and Khachmas regions. 581 livestock farms and 211 sheep and goat farms have been privatized. A total of 84,000 heads of cattle and 286,000 sheep and goats are kept in these farms. According to the Minister of Agriculture, there are 2,016 livestock farms in Azerbaijan and the future plans are for only 25 to be maintained by the state for breeding purposes. There are 16 private educational institutions functioning in Azerbaijan. They includes 3 colleges, 13 Universities and Institutes of higher learning. ECONOMY September 1 exchange rates 1 US$= 4,240 AzM September 30 1 US$= 4,215 AzM On 1 October, state employees in the education, cultural, mass media, health, sport and social sectors will receive a 40 percent salary increase. As of 1 January, 1997, there will be an excise mark placed on all cigarettes and alcohol sold in Azerbaijan. In addition, sales of these items will require the payment of an excise tax. The estimated cost of the excise mark is 90 Manat (approximately 1.3 US cents). On 13 September, the Russian Government lifted the restrictions for rail traffic from Azerbaijan to the Russian Federation via Daghestan. The resolution (No. 94) issued in December, 1994 as a result of the conflict in Chechnya. Initially, only cargo traffic will be permitted, but talks in resuming passenger traffic are underway and are expected to be finalized in the near future. In addition, Azerbaijan has been offered to join the ""Bishkek Agreement"", which offers visa free crossing of borders by citizens of the CIS. Azerbaijan has 2,215 kilometers of rail, 30,000 wagons and 800 passenger carriages, along with a work force of over 50,000. The port of Baku is estimating an increase of cargo circulation in 1997 to reach 8 million MTs following a ""four sided agreement"" with Central Asia countries. Thus far this year, cargo traffic, 5232,000 MTs between Baku and Central Asia is 16 percent lower than last year. This has been attributed to the Chechyna conflict. Arrangements have been finalized for the first stage of container-truck traffic on the route, Poti-Tbilisi-Baku. Transcaucasian railways or ""TRACECA"", an EU funded project. The projects aims is to increase container traffic along the rail corridor with an aim to market this service to Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Set to begin in October, the initial trains will carry 20-30 container-trucks per week. Following the visit of President Nazarbayev of Kazakhastan, 19-20 September, a number of bilateral agreements were signed with Azerbaijan. These include: cooperation in the transport sector, oil and gas industries, sport and culture and various economic issues, as well as discussing issues involved in the sectoral division of the Caspian Sea. ENERGY It is estimated that within two years Azerbaijan should achieve self sufficiency with natural gas. Between 12-14 billion cubic meters of gas are required each year. In 1995, Azerbaijan produced 6.5 billion cm, but with the ongoing oil exploration as well as the growing interest in this resource. The Republic is estimated to have 214 billion cubic meters in both onshore and offshore locations. January-August, 1996 oil and gas extraction figures are as follows: Oil- 6,069,9000 MTs (offshore oil-5,032,300 MTs, onshore oil-1,037,600 MTs), Gas-4.233 billion cubic meters (offshore gas-4.072 billion cm, onshore gas-160,900 million cubic meters. These figures are slightly down from 1995 extraction figures for the same period. The state gas company, Azerigas, has put aside 200 million cm of gas for the winter months. The usual winter requirement for Azerbaijan are 500 million cm. Because of this shortage, the cities of Baku, Sumgait, Ganja and a few selected regions will be supplied with gas. The President of Azerbaijan has liquidated the State Fuel Committee (SFC), and has declared that all kerosene sale stations and auto filling stations would be handed over to the State Property Committee and will subsequently be privatized. The other remaining SFC enterprises would be handed to SOCAR (State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic). The President of the AIOC (Azerbaijan of International Operating Company) estimates the cost for repairing the existing pipelines crossing Georgia and Russia to be US$ 70 million while the construction costs for the western pipeline (through Georgia) would be US$ 275 million. MISCELLANEOUS Two major world airlines, KLM and British Airways, began service to Baku in September. KLM will fly Amsterdam-Baku-Teheran while BA flies direct London-Baku three times a week. September saw the arrival of new Ambassadors for Turkey and Israel and the opening of the Argentinian Embassy.

The crop is growing at a steady rate from the initial season, in 1992 with a net harvest of 16.400 MTs. 128,100 MTs of cotton have been picked thus far in Azerbaijan. The state order is for 310,000 MTs. Many IDPS are involved in this harvest earning 300 manats per kilo. According to the Ministry of Bread Products, Azerbaijan has purchased 257,000 MTs of grain this year, with 179,000 MTs being wheat and 77,000 MTs of barley. This is an increase of 22,000 MTs over last year. The Ministry claims it requires a minimum of 1.1 million MTs of grain per year. Preparations for the autumn sowing is continuing, 635,000 hectares (520,000 for wheat and 115,000 of barley) will be planted. On 26 August, the price of bread and all bread products increased by 100 Manats. This follows a 20 percent increase in July. In 1996, each month has seen a rise in price. The projected mixed vegetable harvest this year is 150,000 MTs. This includes 45,000 MTs of tomatoes, 5,000 MTs of cabbage, and 3,650 MTs of onions. Thus far 56,000 MTs or 37 percent of the projection have been harvested. The Minister of Agriculture, stated that of the total areas of land in the Republic, 8,641,000 hectares, 3,864,000 (45 percent) hectares will remain in Government hands, while 2,866,000 (33 percent) hectares will be transferred to municipal property and the remaining 1,911,000 (22 percent) will be privatized. A list of 3.8 million people who will be eligible to receive these private lands has been compiled. The arid summer has affected the quantity and quality of nut production. Mostly grown in the northern regions, an area of 16,895 hectares is usually planted. Last years yield was 10,336 MTs and this years it was expected to be close to 11,700 MTs, but the Ministry of Agriculture (MoAG) predicts a sharp decrease in the yield owing to the arid summer. As of mid-September, 48,000 MTs of grapes have been harvested. This figure represents 32 percent of the planned yield. Azeri scientists have announced they have developed a new type of pomegranate. It is more resistant, has a larger yield capacity, and contains 6 percent more sugar content than ordinary ones. PRIVATIZATION A World Bank Mission visited Azerbaijan with the goal of speeding up their 20 million Dollar project of establishing five pilot farmer economies, by reorganising the collective and state farms of the Uchar, Barda, Lenkoran, Salyan, and Khachmas regions. 581 livestock farms and 211 sheep and goat farms have been privatized. A total of 84,000 heads of cattle and 286,000 sheep and goats are kept in these farms. According to the Minister of Agriculture, there are 2,016 livestock farms in Azerbaijan and the future plans are for only 25 to be maintained by the state for breeding purposes. There are 16 private educational institutions functioning in Azerbaijan. They includes 3 colleges, 13 Universities and Institutes of higher learning. ECONOMY September 1 exchange rates 1 US$= 4,240 AzM September 30 1 US$= 4,215 AzM On 1 October, state employees in the education, cultural, mass media, health, sport and social sectors will receive a 40 percent salary increase. As of 1 January, 1997, there will be an excise mark placed on all cigarettes and alcohol sold in Azerbaijan. In addition, sales of these items will require the payment of an excise tax. The estimated cost of the excise mark is 90 Manat (approximately 1.3 US cents). On 13 September, the Russian Government lifted the restrictions for rail traffic from Azerbaijan to the Russian Federation via Daghestan. The resolution (No. 94) issued in December, 1994 as a result of the conflict in Chechnya. Initially, only cargo traffic will be permitted, but talks in resuming passenger traffic are underway and are expected to be finalized in the near future. In addition, Azerbaijan has been offered to join the ""Bishkek Agreement"", which offers visa free crossing of borders by citizens of the CIS. Azerbaijan has 2,215 kilometers of rail, 30,000 wagons and 800 passenger carriages, along with a work force of over 50,000. The port of Baku is estimating an increase of cargo circulation in 1997 to reach 8 million MTs following a ""four sided agreement"" with Central Asia countries. Thus far this year, cargo traffic, 5232,000 MTs between Baku and Central Asia is 16 percent lower than last year. This has been attributed to the Chechyna conflict. Arrangements have been finalized for the first stage of container-truck traffic on the route, Poti-Tbilisi-Baku. Transcaucasian railways or ""TRACECA"", an EU funded project. The projects aims is to increase container traffic along the rail corridor with an aim to market this service to Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Set to begin in October, the initial trains will carry 20-30 container-trucks per week. Following the visit of President Nazarbayev of Kazakhastan, 19-20 September, a number of bilateral agreements were signed with Azerbaijan. These include: cooperation in the transport sector, oil and gas industries, sport and culture and various economic issues, as well as discussing issues involved in the sectoral division of the Caspian Sea. ENERGY It is estimated that within two years Azerbaijan should achieve self sufficiency with natural gas. Between 12-14 billion cubic meters of gas are required each year. In 1995, Azerbaijan produced 6.5 billion cm, but with the ongoing oil exploration as well as the growing interest in this resource. The Republic is estimated to have 214 billion cubic meters in both onshore and offshore locations. January-August, 1996 oil and gas extraction figures are as follows: Oil- 6,069,9000 MTs (offshore oil-5,032,300 MTs, onshore oil-1,037,600 MTs), Gas-4.233 billion cubic meters (offshore gas-4.072 billion cm, onshore gas-160,900 million cubic meters. These figures are slightly down from 1995 extraction figures for the same period. The state gas company, Azerigas, has put aside 200 million cm of gas for the winter months. The usual winter requirement for Azerbaijan are 500 million cm. Because of this shortage, the cities of Baku, Sumgait, Ganja and a few selected regions will be supplied with gas. The President of Azerbaijan has liquidated the State Fuel Committee (SFC), and has declared that all kerosene sale stations and auto filling stations would be handed over to the State Property Committee and will subsequently be privatized. The other remaining SFC enterprises would be handed to SOCAR (State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic). The President of the AIOC (Azerbaijan of International Operating Company) estimates the cost for repairing the existing pipelines crossing Georgia and Russia to be US$ 70 million while the construction costs for the western pipeline (through Georgia) would be US$ 275 million. MISCELLANEOUS Two major world airlines, KLM and British Airways, began service to Baku in September. KLM will fly Amsterdam-Baku-Teheran while BA flies direct London-Baku three times a week. September saw the arrival of new Ambassadors for Turkey and Israel and the opening of the Argentinian Embassy.

99,27552,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Kenya: Somalia Refugees Situation Report No. 3,"emergency appeal no. 01.04/96 situation report no. 1 period covered: January - February 1996 Living conditions at the Red Cross camp for Somali refugees in Swaleh Nguru camp have deteriorated sharply due to an influx of over 5,000 unregistered refugees who fled there after the Kenyan governments closure of Marafa camp in December 1995. International Federation and Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) teams are battling to provide additional water, sanitation and health facilities for the new arrivals, while continuing to wait for UNHCR and the Kenyan government to decide whether these refugees can be officially registered at the camp. Red Cross services at the other camps at Jomvu and Hatimi continued to run smoothly in the first two months of 1996, but its support operations for the rest of the year are threatened by the negligible amount of funding received so far from international donors. The Federation appeals to donors to continue their assistance to Somali refugees in 1996 until all have been safely resettled elsewhere or finally returned home. The context The Federation/KRCS support operation for Somali refugees has been running since February 1992, soon after their initial arrival in Kenya. The support services include camp management, distribution of food and non-food items, preventive and curative health care and the provision of social services (education, mental health, physical therapy and vocational training). At the beginning of 1995 the Federation/KRCS shared responsibility for managing five camps holding 100,000 refugees on the Kenyan coast, but by the end of the year the number of camps had been reduced to three and the refugee population had fallen to 25,000. Latest events In 1995, more than 52,000 refugees living in Kenya finally left the country. Some 42,000 of these were Somalis returning home in UNHCR-organised road convoys, ships and air charters costing more than 166.5 million Kenyan Shillings (CHF 3.5 million). In addition, approximately 3,300 Ethiopian, 1,000 Ugandan and 240 Rwandan refugees opted to return home, while more than 6,000 refugees were resettled to third countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. After the closure of Marafa, between 500 and 600 refugees refused to leave the camp, so on 24 January Kenyan police forcibly removed the remaining occupants. Over 198 refugees were transported to Dabaad by UNHCR, while several hundred vanished, eventually finding their way to Swaleh Nguru and increasing the unregistered population in that camp to over 5,000. As a 20 March 1996 result of this influx, there has been a significant increase in security problems, a sharp deterioration of health and sanitation conditions inside and outside the camp due to over-crowding, and a lack of food. Red Cross staff have become increasingly concerned at the situation in Swaleh Nguru and so have asked UNHCR to convene a meeting with WFP and the Kenyan government to discuss these issues and establish a viable policy on the unregistered population. All remaining structures (other than permanent buildings) in Marafa were demolished by the Kenyan government and UNHCR reports that the local government continues to apply pressure to have all camps on the coast closed as soon as possible. This local resolve has stiffened recently due to the increased number of unregistered refugees moving into Swaleh Nguru. The Kenyan government announced a proposal that refugees not be allowed to enter Mombasa without a travel permit, and should a refugee be caught without such a permit, he or she would be arrested and deported. But to date, this proposal has not been implemented. However, the degree of anger and tension within the refugee community as a result of these pressures was tragically highlighted when three refugees (in separate incidents) set themselves on fire in protest over alleged mistreatment by UNHCR. Two of the refugees were Ethiopians and one of them died from his injuries. Red Cross/Red Crescent action Official Red Cross camp population figures for the first two months of the year were as follows:    Camp   January   February     Swaleh Nguru   9,934   9,950     Hatimi   3,340   3,333     Jomvu   5,266   5,266     Total   18,540   18,549    However, a Red Cross nutritional survey estimated that the real population of Swaleh Nguru is 15,500 at present the balance being unofficial refugees. Food and Non-Food Distributions In both January and February no WFP maize was available for distribution so a double ration of wheat flour (400g per person/per day) was given to the refugees. There was also a shortage of beans in February, which resulted in a reduction of the ration size from 50g to 25g per person/per day. According to WFP, stocks of vegetable oil are virtually depleted and some camps will face a shortage in the coming months (possibly as early as May). Due to the continued difficulties encountered by WFP in releasing stocks of sugar impounded at Kenyan ports, the next distribution of sugar is also likely to be the last. The amounts of food distributed to 18,549 refugees for the first two months of 1996 were as follows:    Food   January (mt)   February (mt)     Wheatflour   238.5   223.4     Pulses   27.8   12.8     Vegetable Oil   13.9   13.9     Salt   2.78   2.74     Total   282.98   252.87    In January, the International Islamic Relief Organisation distributed rice, flour, vegetable oil, dates and sugar to the refugees of Swaleh Nguru camp (though outside the camp perimeters and in contravention of the policy established by the Ministry of Home Affairs and National Heritage that all donations of food aid which has been granted duty-free import must be distributed as part of the established food distribution and ration system). One hundred bags (90 kg each) of charcoal were distributed to 100 families in Swaleh Nguru by Red Cross teams, while plastic sheeting, mosquito nets, soap and used clothing (two bales per camp) were also handed out to the most vulnerable in Hatimi and Swaleh Nguru. Logistics Two new field vehicles donated by the German Red Cross have arrived and are awaiting clearance by the Operational Support Unit (OSU) in Nairobi. These vehicles will replace two others which will be rotated out of the fleet because they are no longer cost effective to run. With the scaling down of the Somali refugee support operation, a needs analysis has just been completed and several vehicles identified for release to the National Society (as per an earlier agreement) and to the OSU for other operations within the region. Medical The number of malaria cases and deaths have increased in Swaleh Nguru camp since late December 1995, prompting the Red Cross medical department to begin health education campaigns covering oral medication, environmental hygiene, malaria prevention and the importance of seeking health care at the onset of an illness. This was followed by meetings with elders, private health practitioners and the womens committee to solicit their support for educating the communities on the importance of following Red Cross guidelines on malaria treatment. In January, 1,257 cases of malaria were treated (13 deaths were reported), which fell sharply in February to 967 cases and 10 deaths. The number of patients seen in the Red Cross camp clinics at Utange and Jomvu are as follows:       January   February     OPD   4,778   2,821     Admissions   392   584     Referrals   218   216     TB cases   89   94     Total   5,477   3,715    The presence of thousands of unofficial refugees has imposed severe strains on Red Cross budgets for drugs, medical supplies, water, sanitation and social services. The sometimes fierce demands for assistance have also occasionally erupted into physical assaults on humanitarian workers, in turn resulting in upgraded security procedures in the camp. Meanwhile, a house-to-house nutritional survey in Swaleh Nguru in February revealed a fall in the nutritional status of children under five years (with an overall malnutrition rate of 7.9% compared to 5.1% in Swaleh Nguru in January 1995 and 6% in Marafa in June 1995). The survey estimated that of the 890 children under five in the camp, 61 were less than 80% weight for height and ten were severely malnourished, being less than 70%weight for height. The survey recommended that a therapeutic feeding programme be started for severely-malnourished children and a buffer stock of food items made available to the Red Cross health and social services departments to give to familie at risk. This deterioration appears to be entirely due to the influx of refugees from Marafa, because nutritional levels amongst children in Jomvu and Hatimi has improved since last October (with only 11 and six children respectively still requiring nutritional care). In January, another study identified a desperate need for social and medical rehabilitation services in Jomvu camp. The report (with budget projections) has been forwarded to UNHCRs medical and social services co-ordinators for consideration. The following month, a separate report focusing on improvements to the existing provision of care for HIV/AIDS patients concluded that all HIV positive cases should be relocated to Kakuma and that those people in the advanced stages of the infection should be given shelter, special food, as well as supplementary feeding from an agency still to be identified. Water, Sanitation and Construction Water supplies to all camps were adequate and of safe quality. The commercial trucking in Jomvu camp was reduced following the re-deployment of a Red Cross water tanker after the completion of maintenance and repairs which makes two journeys per day from Swaleh Nguru to Jomvu (carrying 28,000 litres in total). In Hatimi, well operations were also restored. Sanitation conditions in Swaleh Nguru camp continue to deteriorate due to the impact of unregistered refugees from Marafa camp and Nairobi district. To try to improve these conditions, seven sites have been fenced in to keep garbage from spreading, construction of a 28-person toilet block is underway and improvements are being made to the drainage capacity of the existing toilet systems. To assist in these modifications, three more sanitation workers were hired by the Federation/KRCS. In Jomvu, all the toilet blocks have been renovated and UNHCR is planning to construct an additional 20 shelters for ex-Marafa refugees, which will partly alleviate the acute housing problem for new residents. Social Services At the beginning of the year, the Red Cross social services department began to merge its services within the medical and relief sectors of the programme. So far, this merger has been running smoothly. While schools re-opened on 8 January, there were low levels of enrolment in the first two months, though this is expected to pick up in March with the end of Ramadan and the launching of a campaign to encourage children to go to school. Due to the fear and anxiety caused by the ongoing uncertainty about their future in Kenya, the number of refugees seeking counselling by Red Cross staff and volunteers remains high. A special committee was also formed to help address the problems and meet the needs of the handicapped inhabitants of the camps. The Hatimi Community Centre was formally inaugurated in January and two bales of clothing distributed to vulnerable people. KRCS staff also organised the first Womens Conference where Social Issues of Concern to Women were discussed in five workshops in Hatimi and Swaleh Nguru camps between 28 February and 8 March.

These areas cover general management skills; stress management and conflict resolution; resume writing and interview skills; time-management; and drivers training. Courses will be held to build and strengthen staff skills in their current positions, while at the same time preparing them for the new job market pending the closure of the camps. The existing staff structure at the beginning of 1996 was as follows:       January   February     Federation Delegates   5   5     Federation Local Staff   2   2     KRCS Staff (Contract)   61   61     KRCS Staff (Temporary)   70   73     GOK Staff (MoH)   14   13     Refugee Volunteers   296   279     Total   443   428    Outstanding needs The issue of unregistered refugees in Swaleh Nguru camp must be addressed by the Kenyan government and UNHCR soon. This group of refugees should either be relocated to Dabaad camps in north-eastern Kenya; or officially registered and receive appropriate shelter and ration cards. If this is not decided quickly, the health and security of both refugees and humanitarian staff will be threatened. Funding or in-kind donations of soap and charcoal (or another cooking fuel) needs to be identified urgently because UNHCR which normally supplies these needs does not have funding for the project this year.

Food and Non-Food Distributions In both January and February no WFP maize was available for distribution so a double ration of wheat flour (400g per person/per day) was given to the refugees. There was also a shortage of beans in February, which resulted in a reduction of the ration size from 50g to 25g per person/per day. According to WFP, stocks of vegetable oil are virtually depleted and some camps will face a shortage in the coming months (possibly as early as May). Due to the continued difficulties encountered by WFP in releasing stocks of sugar impounded at Kenyan ports, the next distribution of sugar is also likely to be the last. The amounts of food distributed to 18,549 refugees for the first two months of 1996 were as follows:    Food   January (mt)   February (mt)     Wheatflour   238.5   223.4     Pulses   27.8   12.8     Vegetable Oil   13.9   13.9     Salt   2.78   2.74     Total   282.98   252.87    In January, the International Islamic Relief Organisation distributed rice, flour, vegetable oil, dates and sugar to the refugees of Swaleh Nguru camp (though outside the camp perimeters and in contravention of the policy established by the Ministry of Home Affairs and National Heritage that all donations of food aid which has been granted duty-free import must be distributed as part of the established food distribution and ration system). One hundred bags (90 kg each) of charcoal were distributed to 100 families in Swaleh Nguru by Red Cross teams, while plastic sheeting, mosquito nets, soap and used clothing (two bales per camp) were also handed out to the most vulnerable in Hatimi and Swaleh Nguru. Logistics Two new field vehicles donated by the German Red Cross have arrived and are awaiting clearance by the Operational Support Unit (OSU) in Nairobi. These vehicles will replace two others which will be rotated out of the fleet because they are no longer cost effective to run. With the scaling down of the Somali refugee support operation, a needs analysis has just been completed and several vehicles identified for release to the National Society (as per an earlier agreement) and to the OSU for other operations within the region. Medical The number of malaria cases and deaths have increased in Swaleh Nguru camp since late December 1995, prompting the Red Cross medical department to begin health education campaigns covering oral medication, environmental hygiene, malaria prevention and the importance of seeking health care at the onset of an illness. This was followed by meetings with elders, private health practitioners and the womens committee to solicit their support for educating the communities on the importance of following Red Cross guidelines on malaria treatment. In January, 1,257 cases of malaria were treated (13 deaths were reported), which fell sharply in February to 967 cases and 10 deaths. The number of patients seen in the Red Cross camp clinics at Utange and Jomvu are as follows:       January   February     OPD   4,778   2,821     Admissions   392   584     Referrals   218   216     TB cases   89   94     Total   5,477   3,715    The presence of thousands of unofficial refugees has imposed severe strains on Red Cross budgets for drugs, medical supplies, water, sanitation and social services. The sometimes fierce demands for assistance have also occasionally erupted into physical assaults on humanitarian workers, in turn resulting in upgraded security procedures in the camp. Meanwhile, a house-to-house nutritional survey in Swaleh Nguru in February revealed a fall in the nutritional status of children under five years (with an overall malnutrition rate of 7.9% compared to 5.1% in Swaleh Nguru in January 1995 and 6% in Marafa in June 1995). The survey estimated that of the 890 children under five in the camp, 61 were less than 80% weight for height and ten were severely malnourished, being less than 70%weight for height. The survey recommended that a therapeutic feeding programme be started for severely-malnourished children and a buffer stock of food items made available to the Red Cross health and social services departments to give to familie at risk. This deterioration appears to be entirely due to the influx of refugees from Marafa, because nutritional levels amongst children in Jomvu and Hatimi has improved since last October (with only 11 and six children respectively still requiring nutritional care). In January, another study identified a desperate need for social and medical rehabilitation services in Jomvu camp. The report (with budget projections) has been forwarded to UNHCRs medical and social services co-ordinators for consideration. The following month, a separate report focusing on improvements to the existing provision of care for HIV/AIDS patients concluded that all HIV positive cases should be relocated to Kakuma and that those people in the advanced stages of the infection should be given shelter, special food, as well as supplementary feeding from an agency still to be identified. Water, Sanitation and Construction Water supplies to all camps were adequate and of safe quality. The commercial trucking in Jomvu camp was reduced following the re-deployment of a Red Cross water tanker after the completion of maintenance and repairs which makes two journeys per day from Swaleh Nguru to Jomvu (carrying 28,000 litres in total). In Hatimi, well operations were also restored. Sanitation conditions in Swaleh Nguru camp continue to deteriorate due to the impact of unregistered refugees from Marafa camp and Nairobi district. To try to improve these conditions, seven sites have been fenced in to keep garbage from spreading, construction of a 28-person toilet block is underway and improvements are being made to the drainage capacity of the existing toilet systems. To assist in these modifications, three more sanitation workers were hired by the Federation/KRCS. In Jomvu, all the toilet blocks have been renovated and UNHCR is planning to construct an additional 20 shelters for ex-Marafa refugees, which will partly alleviate the acute housing problem for new residents. Social Services At the beginning of the year, the Red Cross social services department began to merge its services within the medical and relief sectors of the programme. So far, this merger has been running smoothly. While schools re-opened on 8 January, there were low levels of enrolment in the first two months, though this is expected to pick up in March with the end of Ramadan and the launching of a campaign to encourage children to go to school. Due to the fear and anxiety caused by the ongoing uncertainty about their future in Kenya, the number of refugees seeking counselling by Red Cross staff and volunteers remains high. A special committee was also formed to help address the problems and meet the needs of the handicapped inhabitants of the camps. The Hatimi Community Centre was formally inaugurated in January and two bales of clothing distributed to vulnerable people. KRCS staff also organised the first Womens Conference where Social Issues of Concern to Women were discussed in five workshops in Hatimi and Swaleh Nguru camps between 28 February and 8 March.    Refugees Assisted   January   February     Mental Health   503   443     Physical Rehabilitation   370   378     Total   873   821          Refugees Education     Pre-School   221   236     Primary   926   1,118     Adult Literacy   174   239     Total   1,321   1,593    Personnel Training and Development The Federation and KRCS relief, logistics, medical and social services departments have jointly identified specific areas of training and development for KRCS staff during the 1996 fiscal year. These areas cover general management skills; stress management and conflict resolution; resume writing and interview skills; time-management; and drivers training. Courses will be held to build and strengthen staff skills in their current positions, while at the same time preparing them for the new job market pending the closure of the camps. The existing staff structure at the beginning of 1996 was as follows:       January   February     Federation Delegates   5   5     Federation Local Staff   2   2     KRCS Staff (Contract)   61   61     KRCS Staff (Temporary)   70   73     GOK Staff (MoH)   14   13     Refugee Volunteers   296   279     Total   443   428    Outstanding needs The issue of unregistered refugees in Swaleh Nguru camp must be addressed by the Kenyan government and UNHCR soon. This group of refugees should either be relocated to Dabaad camps in north-eastern Kenya; or officially registered and receive appropriate shelter and ration cards. If this is not decided quickly, the health and security of both refugees and humanitarian staff will be threatened. Funding or in-kind donations of soap and charcoal (or another cooking fuel) needs to be identified urgently because UNHCR which normally supplies these needs does not have funding for the project this year.

100,27564,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Sierra Leone Bi-Monthly Information Report No.8,"Period covered: 8-21 October 1996 This report has been prepared by the office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Sierra Leone GENERAL 1. On 9 October, President Kabbah met the United Nations Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs in New York to discuss humanitarian developments in Sierra Leone. Both parties expressed concern over the demobilisation process. While acknowledging that systematic demobilisation could not officially commence until the peace accord had been signed, it was jointly recognised that current levels of preparedness, particularly with regard to spontaneous demobilisation, were inadequate. Concern was also expressed over donors reluctance (ODA excepted) to provide financial support to the demobilisation process until a peace agreement had been signed. President Kabbah also paid tribute to the good work currently being carried out by NGOs but added that he was disturbed by the unacceptable practices of some NGOs, particularly those that had -just appeared- in Sierra Leone. 2. Efforts are underway to establish a MNRRR-NGO Consultative Group, which would act as a forum for fruitful dialogue between MNRRR, NGOs and donors, thereby enhancing coordination efforts. The group would enable participants to: a) examine the roles and mandates of humanitarian agencies, b) create operational procedures and guidelines, c) strengthen existing coordination mechanisms and d) create an environment which would enable involved parties to become familiarised with one an others activities. 3. A rapid assessment of Pujehun district by representatives from CRS, World Vision, Food for Peace and UN-HACU has confirmed that people returning home are undertaking preliminary repairs to their homes and resuming agricultural activities. During meetings with chiefdom representatives, assurances were given that assistance would be forthcoming for agriculture and food for work, particularly road repair. The assessment corroborated previous reports that food security was the single most pressing concern of newly-resettled people. The improved security climate in the region is attributed mainly to the increased presence of the kamajors. A detailed report is available from UN-HACU on request. 4. In a statement to the press during his visit to Sierra Leone during the first week of October, the USAID Assistant Administrator mentioned that the United States had contributed more than USD 133 million to Sierra Leone since 1991. During 1996 USAID funded DHA and NGOs active in food and non-food distributions, agricultural rehabilitation, water and sanitation activities, medical services and nutritional assistance. In particular, USAID provided WFP, CRS and Care with more than 47,000 MTs of food during 1996, valued at USD 28 million. USAID plans to support the development of civilian groups involved in peace and reconciliation activities and the retraining and reintegration of RUF and ex-army personnel through micro-projects related to agriculture or simple infrastructure construction. The Assistant Administrator also pledged that the -United States Government will remain actively engaged in providing humanitarian assistance to the people of Sierra Leone.- 5. The second in a series of Inter-agency Disaster Management Training workshops was held in Bo from 16-19 October 1996. Thirty national senior level participants drawn from line Ministries, international NGOs, local NGOs and other agencies participated in the workshop, which was rated as excellent. Some of the major topics covered included: Camp management, Resettlement and Rehabilitation of IDPs and refugees, Refugee and IDP protection, Coordination and preparedness and early warning systems. The third workshop in the series will take place in Kenema Eastern Region 28-30 October, 1996. SECURITY 6. Recruitment of kamajors has continued to occur in the Eastern Province at a rate of approximately 200 per month and there are currently believed to be more than 15,000 kamajors in Sierra Leone ( according to the Deputy Minister of Defense via the British Military Liaison Officer). In Kenema district it appears that the kamajors are being coordinated into a well-organised force with a view to clearing the whole area of rebel activity. In particular, it is believed that the kamajors have cleared the RUF camp at Jui in the southern part of Kenema district, which is reportedly one of the largest RUF strongholds in the country. Support for this operation was also provided by Executive Outcomes and by Nigerian and Guinean troops. Concern has been raised about the agenda and allegiance of the kamajor recruits and there are fears that they could become a destabilising force unless they are incorporated into the demobilisation plan.  7. On 15 October, 1996 an estimated 400-500 people at Magbenteh camp in Makeni started a protest during an SLRC food distribution. Those involved were concerned over issues such as ration size and verification procedures. The tension escalated with the result that SLRC vehicles were stoned by the disgruntled people. In response to this incident SLRC temporarily stopped providing services for Magbenteh camp. This incident underscores the need to sensitise camp populations to the switch from general food distribution to targeted feeding in January 1997. As the population of Magbenteh camp is only 5,281 people the situation was relatively easy to control but if a similar scenario were to occur in Bo the consequences could be far more severe. The recent sensitisation mission conducted in Bo by representatives from UN Agencies, NGOs and donors was an important step towards fulfilling this objective. 8. The security situation in Tonkolili district is still unstable. On 17 October it was reported that armed elements attacked villages in the vicinity of Bumbuna, killed dozens of civilians, prompting residents to flee into Magburaka. Expatriates (mainly Italian) working on the Bumbuna dam have been evacuated to Freetown. POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 9. In his statement at the 51st Ordinary Session of the United Nations General Assembly delivered on 10 October 1996, Tejan Kabbah, President of Sierra Leone, appealed to the international community not to abandon Africa. He added: - Even though we may be on our knees in anguish, I firmly believe that there is hope for Africa, that Africa and its people do have the ability and capacity to overcome natural and self-inflicted constraints, and achieve political stability as well as economic prosperity.- President Kabbah also called on the international community to demand that the -RUF sign the peace agreement without further delay, failing which the imposition of sanctions against them should be considered, including the denial of access to the facilities and territories of third countries, and the prospect of their arraignment before a War Crimes Tribunal for the serious crimes being perpetrated against innocent civilians.-  FOOD AID 10. As the internally displaced continue to return to their areas of origin in certain parts of Sierra Leone, WFP has received a corresponding increase in requests for support for food for work. These requests are mainly to support agricultural activities of communities in the Western Area, Bo, Kenema and Makeni. WFP has been most happy to oblige.   HEALTH 11. During the last week of September MSF(H) conducted an assessment of Kabala town, which is located in Koinadugu district in the Northern Province. Relief assistance is limited at present: Christian Extension Services (CES) is still running a public health and community development project in Alikalia, 30 miles south of Kabala and FAO is sponsoring a Womens Agricultural Project. The EC micro projects are on hold. The assessment revealed that the situation was stable and that the population was coping well given limited assistance. This conclusion is understandable given that Kabala is the leading agricultural centre in Sierra Leone. Health services were perceived to be on a par with most other parts of Sierra Leone: limited medical facilities, poor vaccination coverage, limited epidemiological surveillance and inadequate water and sanitation facilities.  DEMOBILISATION 12. On 7 October, 1996, Bandawo village, an RUF-held area situated to the South of Blama in Kenema district, was occupied by kamajors. 106 civilians were rescued and immediately brought to Blama. During the next few days ex-RUF captives-camp followers ( -returnees- in the terminology of DDR ) continued to trickle into Blama on their accord making a total of 152 by 12 October, 1996. These 152 returnees were immediately screened by the Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) office of MNRRR and the results are summarised as follows: only one individual of 152 admitted to being an ex-combatant, 57 were under the age of 15, 73 percent originated from Kenema district, all interviewees expressed a desire to return to their respective homes.  13. An encouraging feature of this incident was the obvious willingness of the local population in Blama to provide relief assistance in spite of limited resources. Under the coordination of a local social worker shelter and food were immediately provided. Merlin, an international NGO based in Kenema, was also particularly quick to respond by helping the local PHU carry out a medical and nutritional screening process and through the provision of medical facilities. Africare and SLRC also provided non-food items. Following the arrival of the Freetown-based DDR team WFP made a commitment to provide food, through SLRC, from 14 October.   14. As of 18 October the total confirmed -returnee- caseload throughout Sierra Leone is 609 people. Of those 139 are children and 12 self-confessed ex-combatants. The vast majority of these -returnees- have successfully been reintegrated into their home communities.     AGRICULTURE 15. It was encouraging to note that thirteen NGOs attended the second Agricultural Inputs Sub-committee meeting, held on 10 October, more than double the number which attended the first meeting on 26 September. Those NGOs who were not present at the first meeting were given the opportunity to present their activities relating to the distribution of agricultural inputs. The meeting pinpointed the need to develop a common strategy for agricultural input distribution so that farmers do not become confused. MANR (assisted by the FAO consultant) also intends to produce a chiefdom map which will indicate NGOs areas of operations.

It was encouraging to note that thirteen NGOs attended the second Agricultural Inputs Sub-committee meeting, held on 10 October, more than double the number which attended the first meeting on 26 September. Those NGOs who were not present at the first meeting were given the opportunity to present their activities relating to the distribution of agricultural inputs. The meeting pinpointed the need to develop a common strategy for agricultural input distribution so that farmers do not become confused. MANR (assisted by the FAO consultant) also intends to produce a chiefdom map which will indicate NGOs areas of operations.

101,27567,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Somalia Refugees Situation Report No. 3,"Emergency Appeal no. 01.04/96 Period Covered: June - September 1996 The camps for Somali refugees are planned for closure on or before the last day of this year. While the Delegation feels that this target is unlikely to be reached, due to non-co-operation of the refugees, mechanisms have been put in place for the eventual closures. Federation/Kenyan Red Cross operations continue, against a backdrop of rising crime and dissatisfaction among the refugee population with the policies of the authorities. The context The Federation/KRCS operation for Somali refugees was established in February 1992, soon after their initial influx into Kenya. Red Cross support activities include camp management, distribution of food and non-food items, preventive and curative health care and the provision of social services (education, mental health, physiotherapy and vocational training). At the beginning of 1995, the Federation/KRCS shared responsibility for managing five camps holding 100,000 refugees on the Kenyan coast, but since then the number of camps has reduced to three and the refugee population has fallen below 20,000. Latest events The period under review was marked by tragedy, conflict, disasters, general insecurity, refugee movement and the announcement of the closure of the camps. In July, the resettlement process continued with approximately 1,000 more Benadirs leaving for the US bringing the total resettlement caseload for 1996 to 3,065 refugees. Whereas the resettlement programme has been perceived as providing a durable solution for many refugees, it has cast a gloom of despair for many others who have not been accepted . In July, a 33 year old hanged himself in Swaleh Nguru Camp, reportedly out of despair at not being accepted for this resettlement process. The family members were referred for psychological support and counselling by the Mental Health Officer. Fighting erupted in August between the Somali National Front and the Islamic fundamentalists, Al-It-Had, near the Kenya-Somalia border, and one Kenyan soldier was killed and another was injured following a bomb blast in the town of Mandera (innorth-eastern Kenya). This violence affected the refugees in Dabaad and the coastal camps, causing tension and tightening of security by the Government of Kenya. The number of security incidents on the coast continues to increase with four incidents occurring within two kilometres of the Delegation . In late August, the Health Delegate escaped unharmed after being attacked at gun-point in the post office. On 13 August the Kenyan Government announced the its decision to close all the camps on or before 31 December 1996. UNHCR plans to close Swaleh Nguru (the Benadir population) and Jomvu (the Bajuni population) simultaneously within the time frame set by the Government. Dabaad and Kakuma. Hatimi (the Barawa population) would remain open as the entire population of this camp is scheduled for resettlement to the USA and departure should be completed by June 1997. On September 20 the Government and UNHCR announced ""voluntary registration"" for relocation to north-eastern Kenya in Swaleh Nguru and Jomvu camps . So far the refugees have refused to co-operate and remain adamant that they will not move voluntarily. To date not one refugee has signed up for relocation. In preparation for the closure of the camps, the Kenya Delegation established a Task Force Committee and the first drafts of the ""operation scale down and pullout plan of action"" of services and activities have been developed. These include the reduction of services and staff and the movement of equipment and vehicles. A fire broke out in Swaleh Nguru camp on 27 August. T en shelters were destroyed while another twelve were pulled down to prevent the spread of fire. One hundred persons were displaced and an emergency package consisting of plastic sheeting, one blanket, second hand clothing, and a kitchen set was provided by the Red Cross and UNHCR to each family. The first cholera case was detected in Swaleh Nguru camp in August and two children under the age of 5 years died on 11 August while undergoing treatment. Following these events an anti-cholera health education campaigns were implemented immediately and the situation appears to be under control with no new cases reported . Over the past several months, the north-eastern pastoral districts of Mandera, Wajir, Isolo and Garissa, have shown signs of severe drought. In September, the district MPSs appealed to the Government to declare a national disaster. According to the latest media reports, 20 people have died in the famine stricken area of Garissa district. The KRC and the Federation is conducting a joint assessment in the region, where they carried out a drought programme in 1992-94. An evaluation of the Kenya Somali refugee programme took place over a fortnight in September. Its objective was to evaluate the successes/failures and strengths/weaknesses of this five-year programme, and provide recommendations for the KRCS and Federation on how to better respond to future disasters that may strike. Two briefing workshops were conducted; one with the managers and supervisors of the Kenya Delegation and another one with the KRCS, Kenya Delegation, Regional Delegation and ICRC. The registered population of the coastal camps dropped by about 2,000 owing primarily to resettlement, but an influx of new refugees were observed in Swaleh Nguru camp. The unregistered population figures remain stable at 8,000. During September, 21 families left for resettlement to the US. The numbers are not reflected in September's population figures :    Camp   June   July   August   September     Swaleh Nguru   8,344   7,795   7,365   7,365     Hatimi   3,312   3,312   3,312   3,312.00     Jomvu   5,256   5,231   5,231   5,231.00     Total   17,351   16,338   15,908   15,908.00    Red Cross/Red Crescent action Logistics In order for the Logistics department to prepare for the closure of the camps while at the same continue to provide efficient and accountable services, it was necessary to restructure the department and modify the mode of operation for some of its components, such as warehousing procedures, management of vehicles and drivers, and procurement of goods. Food and Non-Food Distributions More than 245 metric tons of food was distributed to approximately 16,000 refugees with an improvement in the calorific intake of the WFP food basket. R ations were issued as per prescribed scales. The food basket consisted of wheatflour distributed as 420 grammes per person per day (an increased of 20 grammes to compensate for the sugar ration which was last distributed in July 1995), lentils at 50 grammes per person per day (last distributed in February), oil at 25 grammes per person per day , and salt 5 grammes per person per day . Although WFP reports that the customs clearance of food imports is finalised the food pipeline remains unstable because an additional three weeks delay is being experienced due to additional requirements related to payment of demurrage and port storage fees.

During the month of July, WFP reported that 300 M of maize and 30 MT of edible oil was issued for cross-border operations aimed at stemming the flow of Somali refugees into Kenya. However, an influx of new refugees in Swaleh Nguru has been reported . In July, 18,938 pairs of sandals were distributed to Jomvu and Hatimi camps, distribution to Swaleh Nguru is scheduled for September. Medical The second Stress Management Workshop organised by the Medical Co-ordinators was held on July 17-18 with 26 KRCS staff participating. A series of weekly training sessions are planned for the nurses and community workers to upgrade their skills so that they can better assist their community. The first positive case of cholera was discovered in August when two children under 5 years from the same family developed diarrhoea and vomiting and died while undergoing treatment. All family members were screened for cholera and the mother's specimen tested positive. The Red Cross anti-cholera campaign team immediately started a cholera campaign which included screening, health education and sanitation. The situation is under control, out of the 37 specimens tested only one was positive. Nonetheless, the Red Cross cholera health education campaign is continuing in all camps. Following an increase number of infested stool specimens found in patients at Utange clinic, more than 225 specimens were distributed of which 100 specimens tested positive with worm infestations. Treatment was provided for the patients. The Red Cross participated in the National polio immunisation campaign on 11-13 August in all camps, the Ministry of Health providing vaccines for 533 children. A follow-up immunisation day is scheduled next month.

Repairs of toilet blocks in all camps was completed with replacement 336 sheets of corroded iron sheets and 118 toilet doors (which had been stolen by the refugees) in Swaleh Nguru with gunny sacks. The sanitation exhaustion is under controlled, however, the toilets are still being misused with food and other garbage being dumped in them. To control the spread of malaria the shelters were sprayed in all the camps and r odent control was also carried out. Social Services School enrollment continues to increase, with a total enrollment of 1,690 pupils in July, 1,755 pupils in August and 1,508 in September in pre and primary schools and adult classes. Following the announcement of the closure of the camps, the registration and attendance in skills training classes has increased, especially in typing and carpentry classes.

External Relations: Government, UN, NGOs, media The communication and co-operation between Red Cross and its operating partners (WFP and UNHCR) improved this reporting period and weekly meetings have been re-established. A routine mission visit was made by the WFP (Regional) Emergency Officer to the project and a preliminary Food Need Assessment Mission was conducted by WFP. The weekly case conferences between Red Cross health department and UNHCR Social Services continue to be productive even though the number of cases requesting referral assistance are increasing . During September 20 students from the United States International University, Red Cross youth department, visited the camps. Regular articles appear in the local newspapers on the refugees in Mombasa and other parts of Kenya which has heightened the community's interest in the movement of the refugees from the coast. Most, it has to be said, dwell on negative aspects such as crime. Conclusion In general, the Delegation has taken the necessary security measures in preparation for the closure of the camps and is prepared to provide essential services until the closure. However, it appears that the camps may remain open past the dealine date of December 31, 1996 should the refugees continue to refuse to co-operate.

104,27981,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,"Minutes of the Sierra Leone Meeting, Stuttgart, 21 October 1996","Dear friends, Greetings. We are pleased to enclose herewith the Minutes of the above-mentioned meeting. We would like to make use of this opportunity to inform you about an important decision that the participating agencies made at this meeting regarding coordination. After careful deliberations and assessment on the current way of relating with the CCSL Relief and Rehabilitation Dept, the agencies decided to coordinate their intervention in Sierra Leone through the lead agency mechanism and Christian Aid has been appointed to be the lead agency for ACT International related agencies. This in practice would mean: 1.All communication regarding relief and rehabilitation work will pass through the lead agency. As a result all correspondence and requests for financial assistance from CCSL have to be communicated to the lead agency, who has the responsibility of assessing and screening these requests and submit to the supporting agencies. 2.The lead agency will communicate with CCSL and on all practical operational questions and will submit periodic reports and sitreps to the supporting agencies and ACT International. 3.Once the lead agency agrees on programme content, this could be submitted for funding to the supporting agencies and their governments, but also will be put out internationally on ACT International Appeal for fund-raising. 4.Relief and rehabilitation related visits from the supporting agencies and ACT International related agencies to CCSL will be coordinated through the lead agency. 5.The lead agency in consultation with CCSL will take all necessary initiatives to develop and to help run an effective programme which will meet the needs of the displaced in Sierra Leone. 6.The lead agency will also advise the supporting agencies and ACT International on international advocacy issues regarding Sierra Leone. Please note also that we agreed at the meeting that the rehabilitation and relief programme could be addressed as CCSL/ACT International programme. We hope you will find the above communication useful. Do not hesitate to contact the ACT Coordinating Office or Christian Aid for any further clarification. Yours sincerely, (Not signed - e-mailed and faxed electronically) Geof May ACT Appeals Consultant Encls Summary Meeting 21-10-1996 in Stuttgart : SIERRA LEONE / CCSL RRR Participants:  - Geof May, ACT (chaired the meeting) - Abiy Hailu, Helen Atkinson, CAID - Ineke van Winden, DIA - Abel Kuiper, CCSL Relief Coordinator - Njell Lofthus, NCA - Dr. Mann, BfdW (partly present) - Rainer Lucht, DW Consultant (partly present) - Hannelore Hensle, Karl-Heinz Steinhilber, Silke Gerer, DW 1)   Short update on current situation 1.1   CCSL Relief Coordinator Abel Kuiper reported that the interpretation of his Terms of Reference had caused misunderstandings between him and CCSL, which meanwhile could be clarified. The  change in attitude towards participatory principles - here, Abel gratefully acknowledged the good advice of Rainer Lucht -, contributed a lot towards a better relationship and cooperation. DIA has prolonged Abel Kuipers contract until 31st December 96. So far he has not got a local counterpart, but recruitment process is under way. The group pointed out the need that recruitment of the couterpart should be based on the criteria of qualification and professionality. 1.2   CCSL Relief work According to Abel Kuiper 90% of CCSL relief work is concentrated in Bo. CCSL is running 5 - 6 camps with a total of about 50.000 beneficiaries. CCSL is mainly working in the field of camp management/construction, health service and education. The security situation in Bo is still instable and a Government security not yet possible. 2)   Positions, Consultants, Contracts For sake of clarification the agencies were asked to give an overview of consultants and there secondments/tasks, who are presently employed. CCSL Expatriate Staff/Consultants - Abel Kuiper, CCSL Relief Coordinator (financed by CAID, DIA and DW)    - Duncan White, CCSL Financial Accountant (financed by CAID, DIA and DW) Medium/long term Consultants - Helen Atkinson, Programme Officer, CAID - Geof Crawford, Technical Advisor, CAID - Martin Whiteside, CCSL Training, CAID Consultant Special assignments / short-term consultancies - Rainer Lucht, Consultant DW (RRR study - CAID, DIA and DW) - Ken Kawa, Consultant CAID (EDRA study) 3)   Donor Consortium - ACT Coordination It was stated that coordination between the Northern agencies needs to be improved, also for the sake of a broader fund-raising. ACT was asked whether they could take over the coordination. An ACT/lead agency approach was agreed and CAID as lead agency. 4)   Relief, Resettlement & Rehabilitation WFP announced formally at the latest inter-agency meeting that general food distribution in the camps will be stopped in December 1996. Only targetted food distribution at the camps will continue from January 1997 onwards. One ""off resettlement package"", intended to last for about 3 months, will be offered to camp returnees on presentation of their food distribution registration card. Food assistance will be given to NGOs submitting approved projects including food for work programmes etc. While the group acknowledged the need for moving from plain relief towards a more qualified, contextual relief & rehabilitation, it was also a common understanding that it would be premature to stop the CCSL relief operation in Bo abruptly by 31st of December 1996, when WFP general food distributions will come to an end. Abel Kuiper was asked to work out an interim program for three months (January - March 1997), which allows for a more smooth scaling down of the relief operation. 4.1 Resettlement & Rehabilitation Programme - facilitated by Rainer Lucht for CCSL Relief Department The programme had been elaborated in close cooperation with CCSL. Pujehun was the area proposed by CCSL. Referring to the CCSL General Secretary's telefax dated 18-10-96, the group was quite confused why suddenly a new area (Bo) and quite a different approach had been chosen. The group was wondering whether CCSL had really lost ground in Pujehun and if so, which other factors contributed to that. CAID as lead agency was asked to clarify. At this stage, DIA expressed its disappointment with the fact that no rehabilitation proposal has been formulated that is acceptable to CCSL as well as to donor agencies.Without a good rehabilitation proposal, DIA will not be able to access back donor funds. The private funds of DIA are very limited. All this will have implications for contributions of DIA to CCSL; in 1997, DIA can no longer be one of the main donors to the CCSL programme. Note: In a direct letter to CCSL General Secretary, DIA will explain more detailed the reason for having to take a lesser involvement. It needs to be noted that the R&R Programme as worked out by Rainer Lucht for Pujehun was designed in a small scale approach, taking into consideration major communities needs (agriculture), specific security aspects and capacity limits of CCSL. The concept can be applied elsewhere. However, when choosing another area the ultimate criteria NEED will have to be applied. Other: For sake of coordination the CCSL request ""income generating programme"" submitted to NCA, was copied to CAID to be assessed and commented on, as lead agency; in January 1997 Stein Villumstad and Njell Lofthus from NCA will be travelling to Sierra Leone and Liberia. SG/22.10.1996 Co-ordinating Office Action by Churches Together (ACT) is a worldwide network of churches and their related agencies meeting human need through co-ordinated emergency response and common identity. The ACT network is organizationally based in the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) and the World Council of Churches (WCC) and is a co-ordinating rather than an operational office.","Minutes of the Sierra Leone Meeting, Stuttgart, 21 October 1996 Dear friends, Greetings.

105,28102,[12033],Mine Action,Country Demining Report,"Update 4 Nov 96 - Up to one person an hour is killed by landmines and shells in battered Kabul, demining experts said Monday, with death and injuries from the weapons up dramatically since the Taliban militia ousted the Afghan Government in September.  Still more worrying is that children are the main victims of mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) which cause horrifying injuries if they fail to kill, the US-based aid agency Save the Children added here. ""The number of mine and UXO blast victims has increased dramatically by more than 300 percent in October from the previous month,"" the agency's field director Zabiullah Asmaie said.  ""Of all mine and UXO-related injuries and deaths in Kabul in the past six months, 37 percent occurred in October. Children account for the majority of victims - in October alone 66 of the 85 people killed and injured were children,"" he added.  Ninety-four percent of reported victims of UXOs --shells, rockets, bombs and bullets fired but not detonated -- in October were children, the agency stated. (Source: AFP)  9 Oct 96 - Taliban officers said they had contained a major counter-attack in the Salang Pas through the Hindu Kush mountains by forces of former government military chief Ahmad Shah Masood, after fierce fighting. The Taliban has suffered about 270 casualties since their attempt to force a way into Panjsher began on Saturday, many of them to mines. (Source: Reuter)  26 Sept 96 - Hospitals are overflowing with casualties in the Afghan capital Kabul as Taliban guerrillas press towards the city center, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. The ""relentless"" fighting had left ""hundreds of wounded, including victims of landmines."" (Source AFP)  16 Sept 96 - Afghan government jets bombed targets in the eastern city of Jalalabad, now held by Taliban militia rebels, on Sunday, killing five people and wounding a score of civilians, Taliban and UN sources in Pakistan said. The sources said the planes attacked the airport, the governor's palace and the nearby Spinghar Hotel from about 7:45am. They also dropped anti-personnel lines near the Behsud Bridge, about two km west of the city. (Source: Bangkok Post)  3 Sept 96 - The southwestern-bound Afghan national highway was open to civilian traffic Tuesday after being closed for one day because of factional fighting, witnesses said. ""There has been little shelling today and traffic started from early morning moving in both directions,"" a security guard at the Kabul government frontlines in Arghandeh village told AFP.  Pro-Kabul factions are dug-in on multiple frontlines some 25 kilometres southwest of Kabul at Arghandeh village, facing their Taliban militia rivals across a three-kilometre heavily mined no-man's land.

The 1.7 mile Soviet-built tunnel opened in 1964, which passes through the Hindu Kush mountains at an altitude of 3,363 metres was the main supply route for Soviet troops when they occupied Afghanistan in the 1980s.

(Source: Agence France-Presse)  29 Jan. 96 - The government reported that the supply route to Maidan Shahr to the west had been cleared of landmines and could be used by civilian traffic. The city continues to be bombed and shelled as the Taliban offensive nears a climax. UNOCHA reports new laying of mines in the area of Kabul city, site of a stand-off between the Taliban insurgency and the forces loyal to President Rabbbani. Although UNOCHA is confident the mines have not been laid in large numbers, officials expressed concern that previously demined areas could be mined, and that the laying of mines might accelerate as the fighting worsens.  Overview 1996  21 March - In 1995, the UNOCHA Mine Clearance Programme, in its seventh year of operation, gained access to areas previously inaccessable for security reasons. Kabul was the most seriously affected of these areas with an additional 11 square kilometres of mine fields identified, marked and mapped. 25% of the total demining effort available was redirected to respond to the landmine emergency in the city of Kabul, which will remain a focal point for demining in 1996.  Over 530 square kilometers of Afghanistan have now been identified as contaminated by Mines and UXOs. Some 149 square kilometers have been identified as priority one, or areas which have immediate impact on people's lives (residential areas, commercial areas, agricultural land, irrigation canals, roads and grazing areas).  The UNOCHA Mine Clearance Programme is now the largest civilian humanitarian demining programme in the world. Over the past six years the Programme has:  * cleared a total of 80 square kilometers of high priority area;  * destroyed over 200,000 devices (mines and unexploded ordnance);  * surveyed a total of 110 square kilometers;  * provided mine awareness briefings to three million people;  * trained and employed over 3,100 employees.  Most of the high priority mined areas around the regional centres of herat, Takhar and Jalalabad and other provinces and cities such as Badghis, Baghlan, Bamyan, Khost, Kunar, Laghman, Nimroz, Oruzgan and Wardak have been cleared. Hundreds of thousands of refugees waiting in the neighboring countries to return to these areas, especially to Beghlan, Herat, Jalalabad, Kunar and Khost either have returned or at least do not see mines as the main obstacle to their return, as they did in the early 1990s.  Although the war in Afghanistan affected the whole country, the provinces bordering Iran and Pakistan (the western, southern and eastern parts) were the most heavily mined. Security belts were established around the major cities close to the Iranian and Pakistani borders, such as Herat, Kandahar, Jalalabad and Khost. The same tactic was followed in strategic places outside the cities, such as airports, government installations and power stations. (Source: UNOCHA Demining Workplan for 1996)  1995  Afghanistan, laden with an estimated 10 million mines, has been memorably described as resembling one big minefield. Grazing lands, waterways, schools, paths, villages and cities are infested with mainly AP mines. Mines are responsible for depopulating vast tracts of the countryside, affecting food supplies into the cities and crop harvests.  The mine infestation affects both rural and urban populations. Kabul is the third largest mined area in the country, mainly due to the Taliban winter offensive of 1994/95, when many neighborhoods were mined after residents fled to safe havens outside the capital. The extent of the problem became apparent after government forces restored order and residents returned unaware of the danger. In Apr. 95 ICRC recorded 1,500 mine casualties.  The Mine Clearance Programme (MCP) rushed 11 clearance teams into Kabul, in addition to seven survey teams and five dog teams. Halo Trust has four teams in Kabul. Demining in Kabul is slow because so much of the city is in ruins. Mined areas are full of metal fragments and shrapnel, rendering useless mine detectors. Mines have been found on rooftops and in underground passageways.  In 1995 Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation (VVAF) reported that in a survey of households in 4,990 villages, 2,277 refugee families, and 1,432 resettled families, mines severely impacted on agricultural activities. ""In the rural villages surveyed, the food production of 43% of the families interviewed was affected by landmines. Landmine contamination prevents the cultivation of additional land totalling 150% of the agricultural land currently under cultivation."" Eighty percent of families cited the presence of mines on their land, and 16% cited mines affecting their irrigation channels. Among the village families, 40,039 animals were killed by mines.  The national infrastructure is seriously impacted by mines. UNOCHA estimated in mid-95 that 327 stretches of road still awaited clearance, a total of 14,731,114 sqm. The estimated cost of demining roads is .80 cents per sqm. Electrical pylons are mined. The country's largest dam, Kajakai, was out of operation for ten years because it was mined. Power pylons linking that dam to Kandahar, and the Sarobi dam to Kabul, are mined.  The repatriation of refugees back to Afghanistan is often contingent on landmines. In a 1995 VVAF field survey, 18% of refugee families in Pakistan said that mines were responsible for them leaving. Thirty-one percent reported mines preventing them from growing crops. Humanitarian organisations report mine incidents increasing after refugees have returned from exile. ""During the mass return in 1992, casualty rates jumped to two or three times the rate recorded during the same period in the previous year,"" reports VVAF. ""One study carried out during a six month period in Peshawar in 1992 indicated that 77% Of mine victims were returnees.""  Casualties October 1996 - In Afghanistan, 2,000-4,000 people die every year as a result of mines an UXO, with a far greater number of amputations. (Source: UN/MAC)  Feb 1996 - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has complied comparative statistics showing the magnitude of the land mine problem over the last five years. Medical reports reveal that 1,606 (close to 20%) out of a total of 9,050 war-wounded patients admitted to various medical facilities in 1995 were mine victims. These figures are incomplete because they do not include data from all Afghanistan's hospitals. Moreover, many incidents are unreported, so the total number of mine victims - dead and wounded - in the country must be estimated at about 4,000 for 1995 alone.  The ICRC's ""Evolution of mine warfare"" tables show two peaks of mine casualties: one in 1992 and another in 1995. The first corresponds to a large influx of returning refugees, many of whom unknowingly entered mined areas in their home regions. The second peak represents an upsurge in fighting between the Kabul government and the Taliban movement. This involved the widespread use of mines in the city of Kabul itself, resulting in heavy casualties among both combatants and civilians. (Source: ICRC News)  1993 - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has compiled statistics of Afghan mine casualties from its hospitals in Pakistan. In a study of 5,189 registered mine injured patients, 29% had stepped on mines; 48% were hit by mine fragments; 5% were holding the mine; and another 18% were injured in other ways. Statistics confirm that recently returned refugees are at the highest risk from death or injury from mines.  Of 720 people admitted to an ICRC hospital in Peshawar in 1992, 66.1% had recently been repatriated and 36.8% of those had been back in Afghanistan less than three months. The study asked patients what they were doing when they were injured: 20% were working in fields or fetching water; 15% were traveling 13% were fighting; 8% were playing with a mine; 4% were demining.  Females were 7.3% of casualties; males of 15 years or less were 19.8%; males over 50 were 4.2%. The remainder were males between 16 and 50. ICRC estimated that 28.5% of all mine casualties lost one or both legs.  VVAF 1995 Survey:  Of families interviewed, 13.6% reported a family member involved in a mine incident. 53% of mine casualties were wounded while tending their animals, 11% fighting, 10% moving within camp, and 7% gathering wood.  UNICEF:  A national mine survey covering 979 villages of Afghanistan's 19,924 villages reported that between 1979-93 there were 20,316 deaths and 15,985 injuries caused by mines. An estimated 20-25 people are injured or killed by mines each day. Of these 8,000 yearly casaulties, approximately half will die of their wounds.  Locations General Locations: Mines and unexploded ordnance are located in almost every conceivable type of terrain in Afghanistan. Major military and civilian positions were mined, including the cities of Herat, Kandahar, Jalalabad and Khost. Mines pose a big danger to refugees returning home by passing through provinces bordering Pakistan and Iran.  According to UNOCHA mines were most usually deployed along unused footpaths, tracks and roads; on the verges of tracks and roadways; in vehicle turn-around points; near culverts and bridge abutments; along damaged building walls; in the doorways and rooms of deserted houses; in and around wells and access points; around military posts; on or near destroyed vehicles; in areas where people might hide.  ""Minefields laid by the Soviets and the previous Afghan Government forces were generally recorded and catalogued according to military procedures,"" reported UNOCHA in 1994. ""However the vast majority of mines laid by the mujahideen were not recorded or laid to any specific pattern. Moreover, the records lost much of their significance as the many areas were fought over, and won and lost by both sides during the war.""  Affected Areas: By 31 May 94 UNOCHA had entered 2,353 minefields in its database and produced detailed maps of 1,334. The UN estimated in 1993 that 162 of Afghanistan's 356 districts were affected by mines;177 districts were mine free;and 17 were still unsurveyed. Minefields constituted 466 sq km; 118 sq km were designated as high priority for mine removal. In that report by the Mine Clearance Planning Agency Report of the National Survey of the Mine Situation, five provinces out of 29 surveyed had the largest amount of total mines: Helmand 26%; Kandahar 10.4%; Paktia 9.6%; Logar 8.6%; Herat 7.25%. The survey found that agricultural land accounted for 20.2% of mined areas, irrigation systems 6%, roads 2.4%, residential areas 1.2%, grazing land 75.6%.  The survey broke down figures for the most affected provinces. Helmand: five high priority minefields; 0.76% of roads; 13.3% of agricultural land; .05% of irrigation systems; 86.5% of grazing land; .09% of residential land. Kandahar: 47 high priority minefields; .43% of roads; 36% of agricultural land; .66% of irrigation systems; 60.5% of grazing land; 2.3% of residential areas. Paktia: 118 high priority minefields; 1.75% roads; 12% of agricultural land; .07% of irrigation systems; 5.5% of grazing land; .45% of residential land. Logar: 53 high priority minefields; 5% of roads; 17% of agricultural land; no irrigation systems; 76% of grazing land; 1% of residential areas. Herat: 86 high priority minefields; 2.5% of roads; 51% of agricultural land; 1.7% of irrigation systems; 43% of grazing land; 2% of residential land.  Number of Mines 10 million land mines.

Background Internal political unrest and the strategic ambitions of regional powers are responsible for Afghanistan's mine problem. Afghanistan, long prized for its strategic location straddling the old commerce routes of Central Asia, is bordered by Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and China. There are 29 provinces and 356 districts (of which 162 are reported to be mine affected).  Afghanistan fell victim to superpower rivalry and regional instability in the 1970s. Following a devastating drought, the monarchy was overthrown in 1973 and Afghanistan drifted leftwards. A series of failed attempts to socialise the agricultural base increased rural-dwellers resentment. After several bloody power struggles, the Soviet Union intervened decisively at Christmas 1979 in support of hardline Marxists. From then until a ceasefire was declared in 1988 Russian-backed government forces held the urban centers against mujahideen rebel assaults.  Government forces were especially partial to the use of millions of small, plastic, Russian-made land mines to protect their positions. Mine clearance teams in Afghanistan report finding literally dozens of types of landmines, mainly from the ex-USSR, but also from Belgium, Italy and the UK. Russian mines include the POMZ-2, TM-62M and the PMN, also known as the 'black widow'. The most infamous mine used during the Soviet Union's occupation period was the so-called 'butterfly' mine. Helicopter crews dropped untold numbers (figures range into the millions) of the small mines from the air. They were designed to flutter to the ground without exploding, and to thousands of children they resembled butterflys or toys. But one wing of the mine was filled with liquid explosive, designed to ignite and explode on contact, severing hands.  Deminers have found the Valmara 69 mine, made in Italy in Afghanistan. The Valmara 69 is a bounding mine. When stepped on it leaps 45 cm into the air, and shatters into more than 1000 metal splinters, causing casualties within a 25 meter radius. There was also widespread use of AT mines, which have the capacity to destroy vehicles of any size and kill and injure dozens of victims.  During the fighting an estimated 50% of Afghan villages were destroyed, and an estimated 25% of paved roads ruined. Crop harvests were seriously affected. Afghanistan is now rated by UNDP as 171 out of 173 countries in terms of poverty and development.  In 1989 the last Russian forces withdrew. The Najibullah government collapsed in Apr. 92 and the winning factions soon fell out. Civil war resumed and in 1994 the radical Taliban faction steadily swept across Afghanistan. In Mar 95 the radical Taliban insurgency was held back from the gates of Kabul after a winter siege that left the capital heavily mined and emptied of 500,000 people. A second Taliban offensive began in Aug 95. Government forces were pushed out of western Afghanistan and Kabul entered a second winter under siege.  Domestic LAND MINE BAN - 5 Aug 95 - Acting Defence Minister Qanouni said that the government would support an international campaign to ban land mines. ""I can assure you that there will be no mines from our side against civilians or in civilian areas,"" he told ministers and demining organizations gathered to launch an Afghan anti-mine campaign. The minister said that government forces would still use mines because the opposition did. But he agreed to ban them from non-military sites, and said pro-government forces would map and mark all minefields and remove them ""once the need for mines had passed.""

The second peak represents an upsurge in fighting between the Kabul government and the Taliban movement. This involved the widespread use of mines in the city of Kabul itself, resulting in heavy casualties among both combatants and civilians. (Source: ICRC News)  1993 - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has compiled statistics of Afghan mine casualties from its hospitals in Pakistan. In a study of 5,189 registered mine injured patients, 29% had stepped on mines; 48% were hit by mine fragments; 5% were holding the mine; and another 18% were injured in other ways. Statistics confirm that recently returned refugees are at the highest risk from death or injury from mines.  Of 720 people admitted to an ICRC hospital in Peshawar in 1992, 66.1% had recently been repatriated and 36.8% of those had been back in Afghanistan less than three months. The study asked patients what they were doing when they were injured: 20% were working in fields or fetching water; 15% were traveling 13% were fighting; 8% were playing with a mine; 4% were demining.  Females were 7.3% of casualties; males of 15 years or less were 19.8%; males over 50 were 4.2%. The remainder were males between 16 and 50. ICRC estimated that 28.5% of all mine casualties lost one or both legs.  VVAF 1995 Survey:  Of families interviewed, 13.6% reported a family member involved in a mine incident. 53% of mine casualties were wounded while tending their animals, 11% fighting, 10% moving within camp, and 7% gathering wood.  UNICEF:  A national mine survey covering 979 villages of Afghanistan's 19,924 villages reported that between 1979-93 there were 20,316 deaths and 15,985 injuries caused by mines. An estimated 20-25 people are injured or killed by mines each day. Of these 8,000 yearly casaulties, approximately half will die of their wounds.  Locations General Locations: Mines and unexploded ordnance are located in almost every conceivable type of terrain in Afghanistan. Major military and civilian positions were mined, including the cities of Herat, Kandahar, Jalalabad and Khost. Mines pose a big danger to refugees returning home by passing through provinces bordering Pakistan and Iran.  According to UNOCHA mines were most usually deployed along unused footpaths, tracks and roads; on the verges of tracks and roadways; in vehicle turn-around points; near culverts and bridge abutments; along damaged building walls; in the doorways and rooms of deserted houses; in and around wells and access points; around military posts; on or near destroyed vehicles; in areas where people might hide.  ""Minefields laid by the Soviets and the previous Afghan Government forces were generally recorded and catalogued according to military procedures,"" reported UNOCHA in 1994. ""However the vast majority of mines laid by the mujahideen were not recorded or laid to any specific pattern. Moreover, the records lost much of their significance as the many areas were fought over, and won and lost by both sides during the war.""  Affected Areas: By 31 May 94 UNOCHA had entered 2,353 minefields in its database and produced detailed maps of 1,334. The UN estimated in 1993 that 162 of Afghanistan's 356 districts were affected by mines;177 districts were mine free;and 17 were still unsurveyed. Minefields constituted 466 sq km; 118 sq km were designated as high priority for mine removal. In that report by the Mine Clearance Planning Agency Report of the National Survey of the Mine Situation, five provinces out of 29 surveyed had the largest amount of total mines: Helmand 26%; Kandahar 10.4%; Paktia 9.6%; Logar 8.6%; Herat 7.25%. The survey found that agricultural land accounted for 20.2% of mined areas, irrigation systems 6%, roads 2.4%, residential areas 1.2%, grazing land 75.6%.  The survey broke down figures for the most affected provinces. Helmand: five high priority minefields; 0.76% of roads; 13.3% of agricultural land; .05% of irrigation systems; 86.5% of grazing land; .09% of residential land. Kandahar: 47 high priority minefields; .43% of roads; 36% of agricultural land; .66% of irrigation systems; 60.5% of grazing land; 2.3% of residential areas. Paktia: 118 high priority minefields; 1.75% roads; 12% of agricultural land; .07% of irrigation systems; 5.5% of grazing land; .45% of residential land. Logar: 53 high priority minefields; 5% of roads; 17% of agricultural land; no irrigation systems; 76% of grazing land; 1% of residential areas. Herat: 86 high priority minefields; 2.5% of roads; 51% of agricultural land; 1.7% of irrigation systems; 43% of grazing land; 2% of residential land.  Number of Mines 10 million land mines.

Background Internal political unrest and the strategic ambitions of regional powers are responsible for Afghanistan's mine problem. Afghanistan, long prized for its strategic location straddling the old commerce routes of Central Asia, is bordered by Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and China. There are 29 provinces and 356 districts (of which 162 are reported to be mine affected).  Afghanistan fell victim to superpower rivalry and regional instability in the 1970s. Following a devastating drought, the monarchy was overthrown in 1973 and Afghanistan drifted leftwards. A series of failed attempts to socialise the agricultural base increased rural-dwellers resentment. After several bloody power struggles, the Soviet Union intervened decisively at Christmas 1979 in support of hardline Marxists. From then until a ceasefire was declared in 1988 Russian-backed government forces held the urban centers against mujahideen rebel assaults.  Government forces were especially partial to the use of millions of small, plastic, Russian-made land mines to protect their positions. Mine clearance teams in Afghanistan report finding literally dozens of types of landmines, mainly from the ex-USSR, but also from Belgium, Italy and the UK. Russian mines include the POMZ-2, TM-62M and the PMN, also known as the 'black widow'. The most infamous mine used during the Soviet Union's occupation period was the so-called 'butterfly' mine. Helicopter crews dropped untold numbers (figures range into the millions) of the small mines from the air. They were designed to flutter to the ground without exploding, and to thousands of children they resembled butterflys or toys. But one wing of the mine was filled with liquid explosive, designed to ignite and explode on contact, severing hands.  Deminers have found the Valmara 69 mine, made in Italy in Afghanistan. The Valmara 69 is a bounding mine. When stepped on it leaps 45 cm into the air, and shatters into more than 1000 metal splinters, causing casualties within a 25 meter radius. There was also widespread use of AT mines, which have the capacity to destroy vehicles of any size and kill and injure dozens of victims.  During the fighting an estimated 50% of Afghan villages were destroyed, and an estimated 25% of paved roads ruined. Crop harvests were seriously affected. Afghanistan is now rated by UNDP as 171 out of 173 countries in terms of poverty and development.  In 1989 the last Russian forces withdrew. The Najibullah government collapsed in Apr. 92 and the winning factions soon fell out. Civil war resumed and in 1994 the radical Taliban faction steadily swept across Afghanistan. In Mar 95 the radical Taliban insurgency was held back from the gates of Kabul after a winter siege that left the capital heavily mined and emptied of 500,000 people. A second Taliban offensive began in Aug 95. Government forces were pushed out of western Afghanistan and Kabul entered a second winter under siege.  Domestic LAND MINE BAN - 5 Aug 95 - Acting Defence Minister Qanouni said that the government would support an international campaign to ban land mines. ""I can assure you that there will be no mines from our side against civilians or in civilian areas,"" he told ministers and demining organizations gathered to launch an Afghan anti-mine campaign. The minister said that government forces would still use mines because the opposition did. But he agreed to ban them from non-military sites, and said pro-government forces would map and mark all minefields and remove them ""once the need for mines had passed.""

106,28140,[12033],Mine Action,Demining Programme Report: Tajikistan,"Tajikistan Country Report Structure Nov 96 - Following a recent assessment mission to Tajikistan, the demining requirements for this country have been defined. The implementing agencies will be DHA, UNHCR and NGOs and the aim of the programme at this point in time will be to reduce the risk to the civil population, UN personnel and aid workers exposed to mines and Unexploded Ordnance (UXO). It is expected that the programme will run from November 1996 to October 1997. Funding required is estimated at  US$ 736,425  Impact of Mines. Mines placed by the three key actors in the ongoing conflict Government, United Tajikistan Oppositions (UTO) and Russian Border Forces are affecting the humanitarian situation in the following manner:  (a) Inhibiting the return of refugees and IDP to their places of origin;  (b) Restricting access for humanitarian and development support to significant areas of the country;  (c) Causing civilian casualties/deaths;  (d) Denying or restricting access to key agricultural land in remote villages and towns coupled with stock losses is increasing dependency on Government and humanitarian aid support.  In order to reduce the risk to the civilian population, UN personnel and aid workers currently exposed to mines and UXO, a sustainable local Mine Action Centre (MAC) is to be established. The MAC must be capable of dealing with mine-related activities in conjunction with the Government and other entities by developing a detailed Mine Action Plan; advising the Government on demining matters; developing and implementing an information and management system; and to coordinate, support or develop mine awareness training.  After a political solution has been achieved, the additional objectives for a full-blown programme will be developed.

Overview SITUATION - Jan. 96 - Tajikistan is mine affected. Land mines are being sown on the border with Afghanistan. The deteriorating internal political situation is the reason why mines have appeared now. Some of the mines have been laid indiscriminately. There are no figures available on the exact number of mines planted.  On 10 Apr. 95 the convoy transporting the Secretary General's Special Envoy to Tajikistan narrowly missed being caught in the explosion from a land mine blast near the Afghan border. The convoy was only 15 minutes behind a truck which was destroyed in the blast; the driver escaped injury. The land mine was located near a checkpoint on the River Pyanj, which separates Tajikistan from Afghanistan. UNMOT observers found two minefields near the border in February, consisting of 350 mines. They were apparently planted by the Tajikistan National Army in the summer of 1994. In Feb. 95 four Kazakh border guards were killed in Tajikistan as they laid mines to protect their positions from Tajik rebels.  Locations The two minefields discovered by UNMOT in Feb. 95 were in the Garm vicinity. Mines have been laid near a checkpoint on the River Pyanj, near the border with Afghanistan.

107,28218,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Sierra Leone Bi-Monthly Information Report No.10,"Period covered: 6-18 November 1996 This report has been prepared by the office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Sierra Leone 1. At the most recent MNRRR-NGO Consultative Group meeting held on 13 November and attended by representatives from MNRRR, NGOs and UN-HACU, agreement was reached on all sides on the precise information required by MNRRR in order to compile an operational profile of NGOs currently working in Sierra Leone. The information required from each NGO includes: Any previous registration with other line ministries, experience in Sierra Leone, geographical coverage in the past and the present, sectoral interventions, intended areas of intervention, staffing (professional and administrative), resources-annual budget, current sources of support. 2. On 19 October, 1996, UN-HACU chaired a key one day working session to enable representatives from MNRRR, the World Bank and indigenous and international NGOs to review in detail the manual containing the proposed procedures for the Emergency Recovery Support Fund (ERSF). The ERSF is the primary mechanism which will be used to disburse funds under the World Banks Emergency Recovery Credit (ERC) in support of the Governments National Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Programme (NRRRP) within the framework of the Quick Action Programme (QUAP). The value of the ERC will be USD 15-20 million if approved by the World Bank. After a productive exchange of views it was decided that the procedures should be redrafted in order to emphasise a more decentralised approach, particularly with regard to the approval, monitoring and funding of projects. A smaller working group comprising representation from MNRRR, World Bank, NGOs and UN-HACU is involved in ongoing discussions to iron out technical details. 3. The information collection exercise to determine the vulnerability status of internally displaced households started in Bo on 8 November, 1996. The purpose of this exercise is to build on information already collected in Bo through previous registration exercises in order to enable food agencies and other interested parties to target vulnerable households more accurately (as opposed to individually displaced people) and to facilitate the shift to targeted feeding programmes in 1997. The system envisages household to household visits by interagency teams (for registered and verified families only) for the purpose of filing in a scoring sheet which grades different categories of people according to their level of vulnerability. These household scoring sheets will subsequently be entered into the UN-HACU database in Freetown. Preliminary results have shown that approximately 50 percent of households surveyed are no longer in situ which is a clear indication that a large proportion of the registered caseload has returned home. The information collection exercise is a large logistical operation involving all the different agencies in Bo and is expected to take six weeks to complete. Technical details have been worked out by the Regional Food Aid Technical Committee based in Bo under the overall umbrella of the National Food Aid Technical Committee. The HACU representative in Bo was nominated the focal point for coordinating the exercise by the National Food Aid Technical Committee. 4. The fourth Disaster Management Training Programme organised by UN-HACU took place in Makeni from 13-16 November 1996. The workshop was resourced by representatives from MNRRR, UNICEF, UN-HACU, WFP, NRC and SLRC and attended by Sierra Leoneans from UN Agencies, NGOs and line ministries. Topics discussed include: Causes, types and characteristics of human displacement, needs assessment, registration and verification of displaced populations, system wide response, camp management, repatriation and resettlement, preparedness and early warning, coordination and the policies, structure and operational guidelines of MNRRR. As usual, the Training Programme was well-received by those present. SECURITY 5. Kamajors have occupied Sulima Village and Mano River Bridge in Soro Gberma chiefdom in Pujehun district as the authorities in the chiefdom failed to comply with the ultimatum delivered by the kamajors at the end of October. (See point 6, Sitrep 22-5 November). While some of the RUF regrouped at Camp Libya, the remaining RUF stronghold in the area located in dense rainforest on the Moa River, others fled across the border into Liberia. Approximately 200 of the RUF in Liberia have surrendered to ULIMO-K and preparations are underway to repatriate them to Freetown. Preparations by the kamajors to infiltrate Kailahun district continue. 6. On 15 November, 1996, 9 people were killed in an ambush 5 miles East of Matatoka village on the Makeni - Kono highway. Although it is conceivable that the few remaining RUF in the Kangari Hills were responsible for this particular attack, it is more likely that bandits or renegade soldiers were the culprits. 7. No security incidents in Bo or Kenema district have been reported during the period under review. The Task Force established by the military seems to be having some success in reestablishing a good relationship between the military and the kamajors following the clash which took place on 30 October, 1996. (See point one of previous sitrep). POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 8. Corporal Foday Sankoh has asked the GOSL for permission to visit Sierra Leone (with the assistance of ICRC) for one week from 22 November, 1996 in order to brief his followers on the content of the peace accord. The Government has acceded to Sankohs request but has indicated that his visit would be most productive if limited to the area around Koindu in Kailahun, given the prevailing security climate in Sierra Leone. It is hoped that Corporal Sankoh will return to Abidjan after his visit and that the peace agreement will be signed shortly afterwards. 9. President Kabbahs first official tour of the provincial headquarters in Kenema, Bo and Makeni, which took place from 16-18 November, 1996, was extremely timely. By reinforcing the overall thrust of the General Assembly issued on 5 November, 1996 (see sitrep 22 Oct. - 5 Nov.) in several different speeches, President Kabbah hoped to undermine RUF moral still further and prompt a conclusion to the war by the end of the year. DEMOBILISATION 10 (a). The National Demobilisation and Reintegration Operational Plan has finally been approved by the Minister of National Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation. The plan seeks to identify and coordinate the activities and mechanisms for a successful disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration policy for Sierra Leone. The plan will cover the following categories of people: RSLMF and dependants, Child soldiers (both Government and RUF), war widows and orphans, RUF and dependants, Civil Defence Forces such as the kamajors. Although the overall plan envisages the demobilisation and reintegration of over 10,000 ex-combatants over a two year period, there are still several uncertainties which need to be resolved: the GOSL has not yet specified the number of RSLMF to be demobilised, there are currently no plans for the demobilisation of the kamajors and there are no accurate figures of the numbers of RUF combatants (although the plan is using a working figure of 3,000 RUF plus dependants). 10 (b). The plan also gives more details on the setting up of reception centres in Bo and Kenema for the disarmament of ex-combatants and their immediate support, the reinsertion and reintegration component of the programme and the sensitisation programme. It should be noted that NGOs have been identified to manage the two reception centres but that the funding to run these centres is only available for 3 months under the UNDP-ODA Trust Fund. FOOD AID 11. Food distribution figures for October 1996, are available from IASB. On request. AGRICULTURE 12. A Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR)-FAO field trip to Bo, Kenema and Kono collected data for an updated Needs Assessment as well as assessing the impact of MANR-FAO emergency projects in the Southern and Eastern provinces. The team believes that the need for agricultural inputs are highest in the following districts (in descending order): 1. Kailahun, 2. Pujehun, 3. Kono, 4. Kenema and 5. Bo. 13. Consultation between MANR and agricultural NGOs is ongoing over the format of a memorandum of understanding which will be submitted by MANR to NGOs operating in this sector in Sierra Leone. 14. The FAO World Food Summit, which was held from 13-17 November in Rome, was attended by representatives from Sierra Leone. TRAUMA HEALING 15. On 8 November Caritas completed its second six week training of trainers on Community-based Reconciliation and Trauma following the success of the first session which was held in Kenema earlier in the year. The workshop, which was attended by representatives from NGOs and the Catholic Church, aimed to train trainers who would, in turn, train community animators to work at a grassroots level to give local communities the opportunity to resolve their own conflicts, care for those in need and make joint efforts to rebuild their own lives. The ethos underlying the workshop is that Sierra Leoneans are a resourceful and resilient race whose perception of their own situation is often different from that of the -experts- and who are able to solve their own problems. Any intervention which ignores the role of the local community is perceived to be unlikely to succeed. HEALTH 16. A recent mission by UNICEF to Kenema to assess the nutritional and health status of the ex-RUF captives highlighted two areas of concern: a) the high incidence of STDs and the concomitant implications for HIV-AIDS and b) reports of adolescent girls being sexually abused resulting in pregnancy and subsequent social rejection in some cases. The CEDC section of UNICEF is currently assessing the needs of this newly identified group of vulnerable children in order to develop an appropriate course of action vis-a-vis health, nutrition and psychosocial support. Concrete data on malnutrition rates is currently unavailable. 17. The UNICEF watsan project officer has recently visited Kenema to monitor progress on the construction of two large diameter wells for unaccompanied children centres and of latrines for UNICEF-supported satellite clinics in Kenema town. CHILDREN IN ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES 18. The Granca Machel report entitled the Impact of Armed Conflict on Children, which was requested in late 1993 by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the General Assembly, was launched in Sierra Leone on 19 November by the Minister of Gender and Childrens Affairs. Statements at the launch were made by representatives from the UN, the diplomatic community, Government and NGOs. Ms Machel uses some graphic examples from Sierra Leone to illustrate the brutalising impact of war on child soldiers. In one such instance the report states that the RUF has forced captured children to take part in the torture and execution of their own relatives, after which they were led to neighbouring villages to repeat the slaughter.

At the most recent MNRRR-NGO Consultative Group meeting held on 13 November and attended by representatives from MNRRR, NGOs and UN-HACU, agreement was reached on all sides on the precise information required by MNRRR in order to compile an operational profile of NGOs currently working in Sierra Leone. The information required from each NGO includes: Any previous registration with other line ministries, experience in Sierra Leone, geographical coverage in the past and the present, sectoral interventions, intended areas of intervention, staffing (professional and administrative), resources-annual budget, current sources of support. 2. On 19 October, 1996, UN-HACU chaired a key one day working session to enable representatives from MNRRR, the World Bank and indigenous and international NGOs to review in detail the manual containing the proposed procedures for the Emergency Recovery Support Fund (ERSF). The ERSF is the primary mechanism which will be used to disburse funds under the World Banks Emergency Recovery Credit (ERC) in support of the Governments National Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Programme (NRRRP) within the framework of the Quick Action Programme (QUAP). The value of the ERC will be USD 15-20 million if approved by the World Bank. After a productive exchange of views it was decided that the procedures should be redrafted in order to emphasise a more decentralised approach, particularly with regard to the approval, monitoring and funding of projects. A smaller working group comprising representation from MNRRR, World Bank, NGOs and UN-HACU is involved in ongoing discussions to iron out technical details. 3. The information collection exercise to determine the vulnerability status of internally displaced households started in Bo on 8 November, 1996. The purpose of this exercise is to build on information already collected in Bo through previous registration exercises in order to enable food agencies and other interested parties to target vulnerable households more accurately (as opposed to individually displaced people) and to facilitate the shift to targeted feeding programmes in 1997. The system envisages household to household visits by interagency teams (for registered and verified families only) for the purpose of filing in a scoring sheet which grades different categories of people according to their level of vulnerability. These household scoring sheets will subsequently be entered into the UN-HACU database in Freetown. Preliminary results have shown that approximately 50 percent of households surveyed are no longer in situ which is a clear indication that a large proportion of the registered caseload has returned home. The information collection exercise is a large logistical operation involving all the different agencies in Bo and is expected to take six weeks to complete. Technical details have been worked out by the Regional Food Aid Technical Committee based in Bo under the overall umbrella of the National Food Aid Technical Committee. The HACU representative in Bo was nominated the focal point for coordinating the exercise by the National Food Aid Technical Committee. 4. The fourth Disaster Management Training Programme organised by UN-HACU took place in Makeni from 13-16 November 1996.

109,28519,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Sierra Leone Bi-Monthly Information Report No.11,"Period covered: 19 November - 16 December 1996 This report has been prepared by the office of the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Sierra Leone 1. Assessments by many different organisations have been made to determine humanitarian needs throughout much of Sierra Leone during the past month. Some of the areas visited include: Zimmi (UNHCR, UN-HACU, MSF, Food for Peace, CRS, ICRC), Pujehun, Bandajuma, Potoru (MNRRR, Food for Peace, CRS, ACF, UN-DPA, UN-HACU, MSF, CCSL, British Military Liaison Officer), Moyamba (MSF, Food for Peace, UN-HACU, Care). This list is not intended to be comprehensive but is merely an indication of ongoing activities in parts of Sierra Leone which were previously inaccessible due to insecurity. Visits by Government, UN Agencies and NGOs to districts such as Bo, Kenema, Kono and Tonkolili, which have benefited from the permanent presence of a variety of relief organisations throughout 1996, have also continued. The objective of these visits is to compile a series of Rapid Assessment Survey Forms which will contain information on demography, community organisations, shelter, health, water, food stocks and logistical support in each of the areas assessed. These Rapid Assessment Forms will be used as a tool to prioritise needs throughout Sierra Leone so that the 1997 DHA Interagency Consolidated Appeal will be as focused as possible in identifying the outstanding humanitarian needs which must be met prior to rehabilitation. POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 2. The Peace Agreement between the Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) and the Revolutionary United Front of Sierra Leone (RUF) was signed in Abidjan on 30 November, 1996 by President Kabbah and Corporal Foday Sankoh. The signing of the Agreement was witnessed by the President of the Republic of Côte dIvoire, the UN Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, the OAU and the Commonwealth. Significant progress has been made towards the implementation of some of the key components of the Peace Agreement. Article three specifies that a Commission for the Consolidation of Peace, which will comprise representatives from GOSL and the RUF, should be established within two weeks of the signing of the Peace Agreement (i.e., by 15 December, 1996). The Commission will be a -verification mechanism responsible for supervising and monitoring the implementation of and compliance with all the provisions contained in the Agreement.- In order to fulfil this task the Commission will establish six bodies namely, a Socio-Economic Forum, Citizens Consultative Conferences, a Multi-partisan Council, a Trust Fund for the Consolidation of Peace, a Demobilisation and Resettlement Committee (to be established within one month of the signing of the Agreement) and a National Budget and Debt Committee. Negotiations between the GOSL and the RUF over the composition of the Commission for the Consolidation of Peace have been ongoing during the past week and on 13 December it was announced that the GOSL representatives on the Commission would be Dr. Sama Banya, Mr. Desmond Luke, Dr. A.F. Joe Jackson and Mr. Sheka Mansaray and that the RUF representatives would be Mr. Ibrahim Deen-Jalloh, Mr. Faiya Musa, Mr. Philip Palmer and Mr. Mustapha Allieu. It was also announced that the Commission would meet during the week beginning 16 December. 3. Article 11 of the Peace agreement envisages the creation of a Neutral Monitoring Group (NMG) from the international community which will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Peace Agreement and the disarmament and demobilisation plan. Important progress has been made in this regard as both the GOSL and the RUF have requested that the UN Security Council authorise the deployment of military observers to Sierra Leone. The UN Department of Peace-Keeping Operations (DPKO) is currently making preliminary investigations into the logistical feasibility of this request. 4. Article 12 states that -Government shall use all its endeavours, consistent with its treaty obligations, to repatriate other foreign troops (i.e., the Nigerians and the Guineans) no later than three months after the deployment of the Neutral Monitoring Group or six months after the signing of the Peace Agreement, whichever is earlier.- Article 12 also states that Executive Outcomes shall be -withdrawn- within five weeks of the deployment of the NMG. 5. On 4 December the UN Security Council issued a statement welcoming the signing of the Peace Agreement. The Security Council noted in particular the -need for a successful process of demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants- and intimated that it was ready to assist in this process. The Security Council also stressed the -importance of a coordinated international effort to alleviate the humanitarian situation- in Sierra Leone. SECURITY 6. Since the signing of the Peace Agreement on 30 November, 1996 there have been several instances in Kailahun and Torikolili districts when small groups of RUF have attacked local villagers motivated primarily by a desire to obtain food. Lacking clear direction from the RUF leadership, hungry and increasingly desperate, these small groups of RUF will remain a threat to rural populations unless immediate action is taken to address their particular circumstances. 7. Kailahun District: On 2 and 3 December 1996, there was allegedly a fracas between kamajors and RUF in the Segbwema region resulting in five casualties and four injured kamajors. On 9 December, two RUF were apparently killed by kamajors in a village 10 miles North-East of Segbwema for attempting to steal food from their families. 8. Tonkolili District: There has been much speculation over recent events in Tonkolili district fueled by an irresponsible piece of journalism which falsely claimed that 150 civilians in the area were recently killed by the RUF. The report was subsequently vehemently refuted by both the GOSL and the RUF. The British Military Liaison Officer (BMLO) visited Makeni, Magburaka and Matatoka on 13 December to determine the precise sequence of events in Tonkolili district since the signing of the Peace Agreement. The BMLO consulted a wide cross section of military and civilian sources during his visit and his findings are summarised as follows: On 9 December 58 civilians were kidnapped by the RUF near Matatoka in Yoni and Taneh chiefdoms to act as food carriers. 23 of those were released later that day due to intervention by the kamajors. Since the signing of the Peace Agreement an estimated 15 civilians had been killed by the RUF in several different villages in Yoni and Taneh chiefdoms for trying to prevent the RUF from stealing food. There are still believed to be 1,500 RUF (the vast majority of whom are captured civilians) in the Kangari Hills, a well-known RUF stronghold which was visited by Foday Sankoh prior to the signing of the Peace Agreement. It is the small numbers of bona fide RUF combatants who are creating the problems although a handful have given themselves up. The BMLO also reported that 300 kamajors had moved into Tonkolili district since the Peace Accord had been signed (although there were only 48 in the area as of 13 December) and that many of the new recruits were ill-disciplined and behaving in an irresponsible manner by, for example, setting up ad hoc road blocks. DEMOBILISATION 9. The fourth monthly Consultative Forum on Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration was held on 10 December by the Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) office of MNRRR and was attended by UN Agencies, donors and NGOs. Several interesting points were made. 9 a). As at 23 November (MNRRRs most recent figures) DDR had screened 1,200 RUF ex-combatants-captives (-returnees-). Of those 140 were children and 158 were ex-combatants. Only 169 had not yet returned to their areas of origin and the majority of those who were still being detained were those who were classified as ex-combatants. It should be noted that the official MNRRR figures do not include the -returnees- who had recently arrived in Largo, Zimmi, Makeni and those who fled into Liberia following the kamajor offensive in Pujehun district during the last part of November 1996. (See refugee section below for more details). 9 b). DDRs demobilisation field officers have been deployed to their posts in Bo, Kenema and Makeni. They will work closely with the MNRRR regional coordinators in these areas and the UN-HACU field officers in Bo and Kenema to improve DDRs capacity to screen RUF -returnees.- 9 c). The identities of the NGOs responsible for managing the four reception centres for RUF -returnees- are now available for public consumption. They are: Kenema: Africare (international NGO) Bo: CRS (international NGO) Mile 38: EFSL (local NGO) Makeni: Association for Rural Development (local NGO) 9 d). The contracts for these managing agencies have been drawn up but not yet signed for two reasons. First, the Demobilisation and Resettlement Committee to be established by the Commission for the Consolidation of Peace (see point one above) will comprise representatives from the RUF as well as from the GOSL. In essence, this means that the RUF must now give their approval before these contracts can be signed. Second, on a more practical level, the managing agencies received their contracts on 10 December and are having them reviewed by their respective legal departments prior to signature. 9 e). The World Bank funded studies entitled Social and Economic Reintegration and Resource Management: Study on Conflict and Reconciliation and Reintegration of war-affected youth and ex-combatants, a study of the social and economic structure in Sierra Leone have now been completed and are being reviewed by MNRRR. These studies will help to shape MNRRRs disarmament and demobilisation programme. It is anticipated that the third study on the RSLMF will be completed by the end of December 1996. 10. There is increasing concern in Kenema district over the role being played by the kamajors vis-a-vis ex-RUF captives. On 23 November, Africare and Merlin registered-medically screened 31 ex-RUF captives in Largo (North of Kenema town) who were brought to the area by the kamajors following a skirmish with the RUF which also resulted in 10 ex-captives (mainly women and children) suffering from shotgun wounds being admitted to hospital. Merlins medical screening revealed that eight child ex-captives were severely malnourished and should be enrolled on their therapeutic feeding programme. Others needed medical treatment. The kamajors, however, refused to permit those in need of medical and nutritional assistance to be transported to Kenema unless they were paid 28,000 leones or two cartons of shotgun ammunition. In effect, these ex-captives were being held hostage so that the kamajors in Largo would receive recognition for their exploits from the Local Defense Office in Kenema, a state of affairs which is completely unacceptable on humanitarian grounds. The matter was raised at a district level by MNRRR, UN-HACU and NGOs operating in Kenema with the result that 17 of the children in Largo were subsequently brought to Kenema for treatment. The issue has also been raised with the Deputy Minister of Defense in Freetown and it is hoped that the kamajors in Kenema will not be so intransigent in the future. RESETTLEMENT 11. Approximately 1000 displaced people from Masimera chiefdom in Port Loko district were finally resettled to their area of origin from the Western area during the past week. 660 people were moved from Clay Factory camp and approximately 330 from Grafton. ADRA and German Agro Action provided transport and Childrens Aid Direct and ADRA registered and conducted a one-off emergency distribution of WFP food to these people at the point of their return. The displaced from Masimera chiefdom originally fled from their homes in August 1996 due to increased insecurity in their home areas and they have effectively been living as squatters in the Freetown camps for the past four months receiving no assistance with the exception of one emergency food distribution. Although there was universal acceptance that the Masimera residents should return to their homes as soon as possible, their eventual return was delayed by continued insecurity in Masimera. While there was much discussion over the possibility of transporting the people from Masimera to the vicinity of Port Loko town as a transit point to alleviate pressure on the Freetown camps, a consensus on this proposal was never reached. Ultimately, it was infinitely preferable that the people from Masimera were returned to their home chiefdom as it will enable them to rebuild their lives as quickly as possible. Those involved deserve much credit as this particular issue has been the bugbear of the relief community in recent months. ADRA and Childrens Aid Direct are investigating the possibility of distributing seeds and tools in the immediate future. 12. The Ministry of National Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation (MNRRR) has finalised its resettlement plan after extensive consultation with a wide cross section of the relief community through the auspices of the Resettlement and Repatriation Planning Committee. The plan identifies five groups to be targeted for the resettlement programme namely: Internally Displaced People (camp and non-camp), Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea and Liberia, ex-combatants and their relatives (both RUF and RSLMF), released persons (i.e., Ex-captives) and locally displaced persons (those displaced in the bush). The food component of the resettlement package will be based on the recommendations made by the National Committee on Food Aid. The non-food component will include: cooking pots, one large kitchen knife, two buckets, two sleeping mats, two plastic plates, two plastic spoons, two plastic cups and two cooking spoons. Families consisting of 1-3 people will receive one set of the above items, families with 4-7 people will receive two sets of the above items and families with more than eight people will receive a combination of the above. The exact composition of the package of agricultural implements including items such as cutlasses, hoes and axes will be determined by the Agricultural Technical Committee. FOOD AID 13. In a creditable effort to provide a flexible response to the continually changing circumstances of those in needs, the Committee on Food Aid has endorsed a strategy whereby implementing NGOs of agencies providing foods are authorised to provide one-off emergency rations to the vulnerable. People eligible for assistance of this kind include the displaced in rural areas who have recently become accessible to aid agencies, newly-released ex-captives (providing they are not classified as ex-combatants) and those who are not registered. The Regional Food Aid Technical Committees will act as watchdogs by cross-checking the identities of those included in these emergency assistance programmes. The provision of this emergency ration will cease when those concerned are physically able to return to their areas of origin (when they will be eligible for the resettlement package) or when they are incorporated into other food targeting schemes. 14. Plans are underway to start collecting data on vulnerable households at chiefdom level so that those eligible for the -safety net ration- in rural areas can be targeted. It is envisaged that households will be identified using the same household scoring criteria currently being used in Bo, Kenema and Makeni. (See point three, sitrep dated 6-18 November for more details). Parties involved unanimously agreed that local communities should be included at every stage of the process so that transparency is guaranteed. In practice, this means that local leaders and chiefdom representatives will: identify the households which should be assessed, monitor the entire process, and exchange information and share grievances at public meetings which any member of the community will be free to attend. 15. Plans are afoot to undertake an Interagency vulnerability survey of the camps in the Western area with a view to facilitating the return of the displaced to their areas of origin during the first quarter of 1997. The Camp Management Sub-Committee, in acknowledging the Committee on Food Aids decision that general food distribution will cease in January 1997, has recommended that the provision of all other services to camp populations in the Western area be terminated in February 1997 to encourage the displaced to return to their home areas in March so that they can prepare for the upland rice planting season. Vulnerable groups eligible for assistance through therapeutic and supplementary feeding programmes will not be affected. AGRICULTURE 16. FAO has received USD 750,000 from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) through the UN Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal to provide emergency assistance to 17,000 war-affected farm families in Sierra Leone. FAO is in contact with the relevant NGOs in Kono, Kailahun, Bo, Kenema, Pujehun, Bonthe and Moyamba districts to discuss implementation modalities. 17. At the most recent Agricultural Emergency Relief Committee meeting, a joint decision was taken to subdivide the committee into three smaller, more focused committees. These are: a) Advisory Committee: which will meet on an ad hoc basis to advise the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR) on issues of concern b) Resources Committee: which will meet on a weekly basis to discuss maximising the geographical coverage of agricultural inputs. c) Technical Committee: which will meet weekly to discuss technical issues such as germination rates, seed varieties, use of fertilizer, etc. CHILDREN IN ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES 18. There have been several meetings in the past two months, facilitated by UN-HACU, and attended by representatives from the Government, UN Agencies and NGOs to develop an interagency strategy for unaccompanied children. Unaccompanied children are defined in an excellent report by a UNICEF consultant as -minors who are living without an adult relative or usual carer.- Unaccompanied children are further categorised as street children, children in substitute families, children in welfare institutions such as orphanages and child soldiers. UNICEF estimates that there are currently 8,500 to 9,500 unaccompanied children in Sierra Leone. 19. Despite the creation of the Child Welfare Forum, an inter-agency body which has an Unaccompanied Childrens Unit, there has, nevertheless, been difficulty in developing a coordinated and unified approach to the implementation of an effective nationwide family tracing mechanism. To rectify this situation a workshop to develop and draft policy guidelines for unaccompanied children have been scheduled for January 8, 1997. Specifically, the workshop hopes to develop a common strategy, to recommend minimum programme standards for unaccompanied children and to recommend an inter-agency and inter-ministerial coordinating mechanism for interventions targeting unaccompanied children. The UNICEF report states that -without a highly structure central tracing office, and very able management, a national or regional tracing system is doomed to fail.- It is hoped that the workshop will succeed in laying inter-ministerial and inter-agency rivalry in this high profile but crucial sector to rest. REFUGEES 20. It has been reported that approximately 2,000 Sierra Leoneans, a proportion of whom are RUF, crossed the border into Liberia following the kamajor offensive in Pujehun district during the last part of November 1996. As of 13 December, ICRC had registered 1,700 Sierra Leoneans in Bopolou (many of whom are believed to be RUF ex-combatants) but the total number of newly-arrived Sierra Leonean refugees-ex-combatants has not been confirmed. NEW ARRIVALS 21. The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), which is part of USAIDs Bureau for Humanitarian Response, has recently established a permanent two-year presence in Sierra Leone with a budget of USD 3.5 million. OTI perceives its two most important roles as empowering civilians to prevent the recurrence of violence and beginning the process of long term reform to address the causes of the conflict. OTI also aims to consolidate the peace process and accomplish the transition of humanitarian relief to a) support for resettlement, while maintaining emergency readiness and b) support for reintegration of the demobilised population (both RUF and RSLMF). OTI will implement its programme through NGOs currently operational in Sierra Leone, namely Africare (in Kenema), World Vision (in Bo) and Care (in Moyamba and Tonkolili).

Assessments by many different organisations have been made to determine humanitarian needs throughout much of Sierra Leone during the past month. Some of the areas visited include: Zimmi (UNHCR, UN-HACU, MSF, Food for Peace, CRS, ICRC), Pujehun, Bandajuma, Potoru (MNRRR, Food for Peace, CRS, ACF, UN-DPA, UN-HACU, MSF, CCSL, British Military Liaison Officer), Moyamba (MSF, Food for Peace, UN-HACU, Care). This list is not intended to be comprehensive but is merely an indication of ongoing activities in parts of Sierra Leone which were previously inaccessible due to insecurity. Visits by Government, UN Agencies and NGOs to districts such as Bo, Kenema, Kono and Tonkolili, which have benefited from the permanent presence of a variety of relief organisations throughout 1996, have also continued. The objective of these visits is to compile a series of Rapid Assessment Survey Forms which will contain information on demography, community organisations, shelter, health, water, food stocks and logistical support in each of the areas assessed. These Rapid Assessment Forms will be used as a tool to prioritise needs throughout Sierra Leone so that the 1997 DHA Interagency Consolidated Appeal will be as focused as possible in identifying the outstanding humanitarian needs which must be met prior to rehabilitation. POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 2. The Peace Agreement between the Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) and the Revolutionary United Front of Sierra Leone (RUF) was signed in Abidjan on 30 November, 1996 by President Kabbah and Corporal Foday Sankoh. The signing of the Agreement was witnessed by the President of the Republic of Côte dIvoire, the UN Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, the OAU and the Commonwealth. Significant progress has been made towards the implementation of some of the key components of the Peace Agreement. Article three specifies that a Commission for the Consolidation of Peace, which will comprise representatives from GOSL and the RUF, should be established within two weeks of the signing of the Peace Agreement (i.e., by 15 December, 1996). The Commission will be a -verification mechanism responsible for supervising and monitoring the implementation of and compliance with all the provisions contained in the Agreement.- In order to fulfil this task the Commission will establish six bodies namely, a Socio-Economic Forum, Citizens Consultative Conferences, a Multi-partisan Council, a Trust Fund for the Consolidation of Peace, a Demobilisation and Resettlement Committee (to be established within one month of the signing of the Agreement) and a National Budget and Debt Committee. Negotiations between the GOSL and the RUF over the composition of the Commission for the Consolidation of Peace have been ongoing during the past week and on 13 December it was announced that the GOSL representatives on the Commission would be Dr. Sama Banya, Mr. Desmond Luke, Dr. A.F. Joe Jackson and Mr. Sheka Mansaray and that the RUF representatives would be Mr. Ibrahim Deen-Jalloh, Mr. Faiya Musa, Mr. Philip Palmer and Mr. Mustapha Allieu. It was also announced that the Commission would meet during the week beginning 16 December. 3. Article 11 of the Peace agreement envisages the creation of a Neutral Monitoring Group (NMG) from the international community which will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Peace Agreement and the disarmament and demobilisation plan. Important progress has been made in this regard as both the GOSL and the RUF have requested that the UN Security Council authorise the deployment of military observers to Sierra Leone. The UN Department of Peace-Keeping Operations (DPKO) is currently making preliminary investigations into the logistical feasibility of this request. 4. Article 12 states that -Government shall use all its endeavours, consistent with its treaty obligations, to repatriate other foreign troops (i.e., the Nigerians and the Guineans) no later than three months after the deployment of the Neutral Monitoring Group or six months after the signing of the Peace Agreement, whichever is earlier.- Article 12 also states that Executive Outcomes shall be -withdrawn- within five weeks of the deployment of the NMG. 5. On 4 December the UN Security Council issued a statement welcoming the signing of the Peace Agreement. The Security Council noted in particular the -need for a successful process of demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants- and intimated that it was ready to assist in this process. The Security Council also stressed the -importance of a coordinated international effort to alleviate the humanitarian situation- in Sierra Leone. SECURITY 6. Since the signing of the Peace Agreement on 30 November, 1996 there have been several instances in Kailahun and Torikolili districts when small groups of RUF have attacked local villagers motivated primarily by a desire to obtain food. Lacking clear direction from the RUF leadership, hungry and increasingly desperate, these small groups of RUF will remain a threat to rural populations unless immediate action is taken to address their particular circumstances. 7. Kailahun District: On 2 and 3 December 1996, there was allegedly a fracas between kamajors and RUF in the Segbwema region resulting in five casualties and four injured kamajors. On 9 December, two RUF were apparently killed by kamajors in a village 10 miles North-East of Segbwema for attempting to steal food from their families. 8. Tonkolili District: There has been much speculation over recent events in Tonkolili district fueled by an irresponsible piece of journalism which falsely claimed that 150 civilians in the area were recently killed by the RUF. The report was subsequently vehemently refuted by both the GOSL and the RUF. The British Military Liaison Officer (BMLO) visited Makeni, Magburaka and Matatoka on 13 December to determine the precise sequence of events in Tonkolili district since the signing of the Peace Agreement. The BMLO consulted a wide cross section of military and civilian sources during his visit and his findings are summarised as follows: On 9 December 58 civilians were kidnapped by the RUF near Matatoka in Yoni and Taneh chiefdoms to act as food carriers. 23 of those were released later that day due to intervention by the kamajors. Since the signing of the Peace Agreement an estimated 15 civilians had been killed by the RUF in several different villages in Yoni and Taneh chiefdoms for trying to prevent the RUF from stealing food. There are still believed to be 1,500 RUF (the vast majority of whom are captured civilians) in the Kangari Hills, a well-known RUF stronghold which was visited by Foday Sankoh prior to the signing of the Peace Agreement. It is the small numbers of bona fide RUF combatants who are creating the problems although a handful have given themselves up. The BMLO also reported that 300 kamajors had moved into Tonkolili district since the Peace Accord had been signed (although there were only 48 in the area as of 13 December) and that many of the new recruits were ill-disciplined and behaving in an irresponsible manner by, for example, setting up ad hoc road blocks. DEMOBILISATION 9. The fourth monthly Consultative Forum on Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration was held on 10 December by the Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) office of MNRRR and was attended by UN Agencies, donors and NGOs. Several interesting points were made. 9 a). As at 23 November (MNRRRs most recent figures) DDR had screened 1,200 RUF ex-combatants-captives (-returnees-). Of those 140 were children and 158 were ex-combatants. Only 169 had not yet returned to their areas of origin and the majority of those who were still being detained were those who were classified as ex-combatants. It should be noted that the official MNRRR figures do not include the -returnees- who had recently arrived in Largo, Zimmi, Makeni and those who fled into Liberia following the kamajor offensive in Pujehun district during the last part of November 1996. (See refugee section below for more details). 9 b). DDRs demobilisation field officers have been deployed to their posts in Bo, Kenema and Makeni. They will work closely with the MNRRR regional coordinators in these areas and the UN-HACU field officers in Bo and Kenema to improve DDRs capacity to screen RUF -returnees.- 9 c). The identities of the NGOs responsible for managing the four reception centres for RUF -returnees- are now available for public consumption. They are: Kenema: Africare (international NGO) Bo: CRS (international NGO) Mile 38: EFSL (local NGO) Makeni: Association for Rural Development (local NGO) 9 d). The contracts for these managing agencies have been drawn up but not yet signed for two reasons. First, the Demobilisation and Resettlement Committee to be established by the Commission for the Consolidation of Peace (see point one above) will comprise representatives from the RUF as well as from the GOSL. In essence, this means that the RUF must now give their approval before these contracts can be signed. Second, on a more practical level, the managing agencies received their contracts on 10 December and are having them reviewed by their respective legal departments prior to signature. 9 e). The World Bank funded studies entitled Social and Economic Reintegration and Resource Management: Study on Conflict and Reconciliation and Reintegration of war-affected youth and ex-combatants, a study of the social and economic structure in Sierra Leone have now been completed and are being reviewed by MNRRR. These studies will help to shape MNRRRs disarmament and demobilisation programme. It is anticipated that the third study on the RSLMF will be completed by the end of December 1996. 10. There is increasing concern in Kenema district over the role being played by the kamajors vis-a-vis ex-RUF captives. On 23 November, Africare and Merlin registered-medically screened 31 ex-RUF captives in Largo (North of Kenema town) who were brought to the area by the kamajors following a skirmish with the RUF which also resulted in 10 ex-captives (mainly women and children) suffering from shotgun wounds being admitted to hospital. Merlins medical screening revealed that eight child ex-captives were severely malnourished and should be enrolled on their therapeutic feeding programme. Others needed medical treatment. The kamajors, however, refused to permit those in need of medical and nutritional assistance to be transported to Kenema unless they were paid 28,000 leones or two cartons of shotgun ammunition. In effect, these ex-captives were being held hostage so that the kamajors in Largo would receive recognition for their exploits from the Local Defense Office in Kenema, a state of affairs which is completely unacceptable on humanitarian grounds. The matter was raised at a district level by MNRRR, UN-HACU and NGOs operating in Kenema with the result that 17 of the children in Largo were subsequently brought to Kenema for treatment. The issue has also been raised with the Deputy Minister of Defense in Freetown and it is hoped that the kamajors in Kenema will not be so intransigent in the future. RESETTLEMENT 11. Approximately 1000 displaced people from Masimera chiefdom in Port Loko district were finally resettled to their area of origin from the Western area during the past week. 660 people were moved from Clay Factory camp and approximately 330 from Grafton. ADRA and German Agro Action provided transport and Childrens Aid Direct and ADRA registered and conducted a one-off emergency distribution of WFP food to these people at the point of their return. The displaced from Masimera chiefdom originally fled from their homes in August 1996 due to increased insecurity in their home areas and they have effectively been living as squatters in the Freetown camps for the past four months receiving no assistance with the exception of one emergency food distribution. Although there was universal acceptance that the Masimera residents should return to their homes as soon as possible, their eventual return was delayed by continued insecurity in Masimera. While there was much discussion over the possibility of transporting the people from Masimera to the vicinity of Port Loko town as a transit point to alleviate pressure on the Freetown camps, a consensus on this proposal was never reached. Ultimately, it was infinitely preferable that the people from Masimera were returned to their home chiefdom as it will enable them to rebuild their lives as quickly as possible. Those involved deserve much credit as this particular issue has been the bugbear of the relief community in recent months. ADRA and Childrens Aid Direct are investigating the possibility of distributing seeds and tools in the immediate future. 12. The Ministry of National Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation (MNRRR) has finalised its resettlement plan after extensive consultation with a wide cross section of the relief community through the auspices of the Resettlement and Repatriation Planning Committee. The plan identifies five groups to be targeted for the resettlement programme namely: Internally Displaced People (camp and non-camp), Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea and Liberia, ex-combatants and their relatives (both RUF and RSLMF), released persons (i.e., Ex-captives) and locally displaced persons (those displaced in the bush). The food component of the resettlement package will be based on the recommendations made by the National Committee on Food Aid. The non-food component will include: cooking pots, one large kitchen knife, two buckets, two sleeping mats, two plastic plates, two plastic spoons, two plastic cups and two cooking spoons. Families consisting of 1-3 people will receive one set of the above items, families with 4-7 people will receive two sets of the above items and families with more than eight people will receive a combination of the above. The exact composition of the package of agricultural implements including items such as cutlasses, hoes and axes will be determined by the Agricultural Technical Committee. FOOD AID 13. In a creditable effort to provide a flexible response to the continually changing circumstances of those in needs, the Committee on Food Aid has endorsed a strategy whereby implementing NGOs of agencies providing foods are authorised to provide one-off emergency rations to the vulnerable. People eligible for assistance of this kind include the displaced in rural areas who have recently become accessible to aid agencies, newly-released ex-captives (providing they are not classified as ex-combatants) and those who are not registered. The Regional Food Aid Technical Committees will act as watchdogs by cross-checking the identities of those included in these emergency assistance programmes. The provision of this emergency ration will cease when those concerned are physically able to return to their areas of origin (when they will be eligible for the resettlement package) or when they are incorporated into other food targeting schemes. 14. Plans are underway to start collecting data on vulnerable households at chiefdom level so that those eligible for the -safety net ration- in rural areas can be targeted. It is envisaged that households will be identified using the same household scoring criteria currently being used in Bo, Kenema and Makeni. (See point three, sitrep dated 6-18 November for more details). Parties involved unanimously agreed that local communities should be included at every stage of the process so that transparency is guaranteed. In practice, this means that local leaders and chiefdom representatives will: identify the households which should be assessed, monitor the entire process, and exchange information and share grievances at public meetings which any member of the community will be free to attend. 15. Plans are afoot to undertake an Interagency vulnerability survey of the camps in the Western area with a view to facilitating the return of the displaced to their areas of origin during the first quarter of 1997. The Camp Management Sub-Committee, in acknowledging the Committee on Food Aids decision that general food distribution will cease in January 1997, has recommended that the provision of all other services to camp populations in the Western area be terminated in February 1997 to encourage the displaced to return to their home areas in March so that they can prepare for the upland rice planting season. Vulnerable groups eligible for assistance through therapeutic and supplementary feeding programmes will not be affected. AGRICULTURE 16. FAO has received USD 750,000 from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) through the UN Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal to provide emergency assistance to 17,000 war-affected farm families in Sierra Leone. FAO is in contact with the relevant NGOs in Kono, Kailahun, Bo, Kenema, Pujehun, Bonthe and Moyamba districts to discuss implementation modalities. 17. At the most recent Agricultural Emergency Relief Committee meeting, a joint decision was taken to subdivide the committee into three smaller, more focused committees. These are: a) Advisory Committee: which will meet on an ad hoc basis to advise the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR) on issues of concern b) Resources Committee: which will meet on a weekly basis to discuss maximising the geographical coverage of agricultural inputs. c) Technical Committee: which will meet weekly to discuss technical issues such as germination rates, seed varieties, use of fertilizer, etc. CHILDREN IN ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES 18. There have been several meetings in the past two months, facilitated by UN-HACU, and attended by representatives from the Government, UN Agencies and NGOs to develop an interagency strategy for unaccompanied children. Unaccompanied children are defined in an excellent report by a UNICEF consultant as -minors who are living without an adult relative or usual carer.- Unaccompanied children are further categorised as street children, children in substitute families, children in welfare institutions such as orphanages and child soldiers. UNICEF estimates that there are currently 8,500 to 9,500 unaccompanied children in Sierra Leone. 19. Despite the creation of the Child Welfare Forum, an inter-agency body which has an Unaccompanied Childrens Unit, there has, nevertheless, been difficulty in developing a coordinated and unified approach to the implementation of an effective nationwide family tracing mechanism. To rectify this situation a workshop to develop and draft policy guidelines for unaccompanied children have been scheduled for January 8, 1997. Specifically, the workshop hopes to develop a common strategy, to recommend minimum programme standards for unaccompanied children and to recommend an inter-agency and inter-ministerial coordinating mechanism for interventions targeting unaccompanied children. The UNICEF report states that -without a highly structure central tracing office, and very able management, a national or regional tracing system is doomed to fail.- It is hoped that the workshop will succeed in laying inter-ministerial and inter-agency rivalry in this high profile but crucial sector to rest. REFUGEES 20. It has been reported that approximately 2,000 Sierra Leoneans, a proportion of whom are RUF, crossed the border into Liberia following the kamajor offensive in Pujehun district during the last part of November 1996. As of 13 December, ICRC had registered 1,700 Sierra Leoneans in Bopolou (many of whom are believed to be RUF ex-combatants) but the total number of newly-arrived Sierra Leonean refugees-ex-combatants has not been confirmed. NEW ARRIVALS 21. The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), which is part of USAIDs Bureau for Humanitarian Response, has recently established a permanent two-year presence in Sierra Leone with a budget of USD 3.5 million. OTI perceives its two most important roles as empowering civilians to prevent the recurrence of violence and beginning the process of long term reform to address the causes of the conflict. OTI also aims to consolidate the peace process and accomplish the transition of humanitarian relief to a) support for resettlement, while maintaining emergency readiness and b) support for reintegration of the demobilised population (both RUF and RSLMF). OTI will implement its programme through NGOs currently operational in Sierra Leone, namely Africare (in Kenema), World Vision (in Bo) and Care (in Moyamba and Tonkolili).

Over the last few days, some Rwandan refugees have also sought asylum in Uganda.  DEVELOPMENTS  TANZANIA Ngara:  A column of around 100,000 Rwandan refugees stretching some 43 kilometres has been proceeding towards the Rwandan border. The group includes refugees from camps in the Kitali area and thousands who had been forced into the forest by intimidators last week. As of today, all Rwandan refugees from Ngara camps will have moved. Karagwe:  As of 18 December, 3,500 in refugees from Rubwera, 1,500 from Kagenyi, and 600 from Chabalisa had registered for repatriation. Of them 1,872 had already been transported to Rwanda and SO Karagwe is negotiating for additional trucks to help meet the increasing demand.

This includes cholera antibiotics valued at $25,000, re-hydration tablets valued at $6,000, blankets valued at $35,500, beef and hospital supplies valued at $71,432, rice valued at $273,000. - CWS is taking on the role of liaison partner for Action by Churches Together (ACT) in North Korea and will be responsible for coordinating response of the ACT Network through a new World Food Program (WFP) International Officer based in Pyongyang. Thanks to the following for support of the 1995 appeal: -- Christian Church (Disciples of Christ): $ 12,000 -- Church of the Brethren: $ 42,000 -- Korean Presbyterian Church: $ 12,122 -- Lutheran World Relief: $ 15,000 -- Reformed Church in America: $ 10,000 -- Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.): $ 20,000 -- United Church Board for World Ministries: $ 21,500 -- United Methodist Committee on Relief: $ 20,000 -- Public & Other Sources: $ 19,987 -- Blanket Funds: $139,784 SITUATION: Food production from the 1996 harvest in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) will only meet needs for the first seven months of 1997. Massive aid will be required with overall grain import requirements estimated at 2.36 million metric tons. Lack of foreign exchange, a large international debt, and limited access to credit hampers the nation's capacity to acquire needed food commercially. The food crisis stems from systemic food production problems compounded by severe flooding in 1995 and 1996 that caused considerable devastation and suffering and set back agriculture. North Korea has avoided large- scale famine only because of a an effective Public Distribution System that assures minimum quantities of essential food commodities for its entire population. URGENT NEEDS: Funds for: - Emergency food supplies - Material aid coordinating activities CWS will assist in meeting needs as implementing partner for Action by Churches Together (ACT), which is planning a humanitarian relief program calling for shipments of rice, maize, wheat, blended food, spring barley seed, and plastic sheeting (to protect seedlings during winter) to North Korea during 1997. Diakonisches Werk will handle purchasing and shipping for the ACT North Korean program and CWS will represent the ACT network in relating to a World Food Program (WFP) International Officer. The WFP International Officer, who will be seconded from NGOs, will coordinate material aid contributions to North Korea with NGOs and the DPRK government, monitor feeding programs, and oversee and implement information/reporting activities. ACT has recommended appointment of Erich Weingarner, a Canadian, for the position. A CWS delegation will visit North Korea from January 21 to 28 to see the start of distribution of a rice shipment CWS recently arranged.

112,28661,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Acts Appeal (AFZR64) Humanitarian Assistance to North and South Kivu in eastern Zaire 20/12/96,"Co-ordinating Office Action by Churches Together (ACT) is a worldwide network of Churches and their related agencies meeting human need through co-ordinated emergency response and common identity. The ACT  network is organizationally based in the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) and the World Council of Churches(WCC) and is a co-ordinating rather than operational office. Geneva, December 20, 1996  War in North and South Kivu has led to the displacement of thousands of Zaireans. Many are wounded, have lost their homes and property, or are dead. The Kivu Region of Eastern Zaire has long been neglected by its national government , completely cut off from development opportunities and resources. The recent upheaval has been set against a backdrop of dilapidated or nonexistent infrastructure, making those fleeing all the more vulnerable. In addition, Zairean currency has become almost obsolete in this region and the rural exodus has affected the economic base of the countryside. The recent ACT Assessment Mission to the region has confirmed that, in order to help these people to regain some level of stability in their lives, we as a Network should concentrate on:  - providing immediate medical and food assistance to the displaced and refugees  - convincing people to go home by assisting them to resume their normal activities It is also time to assist our local implementing partners to get back on their feet, as is witnessed by the following Appeal. I  ACT/CA - Humanitarian Aid for Zairian Displaced Component Following the advance of the rebel movement, the ""Alliance Démocratique pour la Libération du Congo-Zaire"" (ADLC), through South Kivu, tens of thousands of Zairians fled from their homes in Bukavu and nearby villages and took refuge in the surrounding mountainous areas. The more isolated villages were considered to be safer than the towns as they were not of strategic interest to the opposing forces. Despite the relative calm in Bukavu since the capture of the town from the hands of the Zairian Armed Forces (FAZ), the vast majority of displaced prefer to stay in the villages, fearing a counter-attack on the part of the FAZ.  ACT/Christian Aid staff in South Kivu have carried out a survey in the zone of Walungu, approximately 50km to the South West of Bukavu, which shows that the population in villages in the area has more than quadrupled. The ACT Assessment Mission to South Kivu confirmed these figures. No camps have been created, but living conditions are extremely overcrowded. Partners returning from other zones of South Kivu have spoken of similar problems.  Perhaps the gravest problem at the moment, however, is the food situation in the region. The permanent inhabitants of the villages are subsistence farmers, having lost the incentive to produce surplus stocks due to lack of access to markets over recent years (poor roads and high military road ""taxes"" leading to a huge drop in the number of vehicles reaching remote areas). Food which would normally feed one family, therefore, is now feeding 4 families. ACT/Christian Aid has supported Zairean churches and NGOs in the Bukavu region of Eastern Zaire for the past 10 years. ACT/Christian Aid will coordinate relief activities for 4000 displaced families, with delivery and distribution of food and non-food items carried out by the following local partners:  Pain pour les déshérités (PLD) -- Has provided emergency assistance to Rwandan refugees and credit to Zaireans repatriated from Rwanda. ASOP/CDI -- An NGO active in erosion prevention, agroforestry, supply of seeds and credit. SOCOPS -- This NGO organizes training and cooperation through credit programs in agriculture. UDAC -- An NGO which provides health insurance. Eglise du Christ au Zaire -- Active throughout North/South Kivu in relief distribution. ACT/CA will manage the project (admin, procurement, logistics, financial reporting etc.), while the above-mentioned local partner organisations will organise committees of displaced people and carry out the distributions. Some food stocks are already available for purchase in Bukavu - all purchases will be made locally or in the region. Trucks for transporting goods into the villages housing displaced are available. Distributions will be made per family, based on an average of 5 persons per family. Each family will receive a month's supply of rice, maize, beans, palm oil, salt, soap and blankets. It is hoped that the time period of one month for this project will be enough to keep hunger at bay while allowing the displaced to readjust to the political realities of the area. The project will be implemented in coordination with other NGO and UN agency programmes in the area.  Since the ACT/CA office lost its vehicle during the fighting, the cost of a 4WD pick-up for use in distributions will also be included in the budget as will the wages for 2 additional local staff who will work for the ACT/CA office on a temporary basis for 6 months. Likewise, when organising the distributions, the partners of CA will need to employ experienced staff on a temporary basis to ensure distributions are carried out in an orderly fashion. II ACT/NCA and ACT/CEPZA-CELPA Emergency Assistance Programme, Kisangani, ZAIRE Prior to the recent crisis in Eastern Zaire, ACT/NCA through ACT/CEPZA-CELPA provided assistance to 50,000 Rwandan refugees in 7 camps around Bukavu. Activities included medical care,supplementary feeding, non-food distribution, camp management, services for unaccompanied minors and education.  Since the flight of Rwandan refugees from Bukavu, although CEPZA-CELPA lost 10 vehicles and many supplies, the staff has started a clinic for Zaireans in Bukavu.  Following the rebel uprising in Kivu, quite a large part of Eastern Zaire has come under the control of the Banyamulenge and the Allied Force. This has resulted in a major displacement of the local Zairean population. In addition, the unexpected situation has also brought the camp setting for the many Rwandese refugees in the region to an end. Consequently, although a large number of the refugees have returned to Rwanda, many remain scattered in the area of Walikali, Lubuto, Shatunda, Kachungu etc. Therefore, this proposal is to respond to the emergency needs of the displaced Zairians and the disrupted Rwandese refugees. Events began to change in Eastern Zaire with the Banyamulenge uprising in October 1996.  Although the rebel ADFL force is controlling quite a large portion of Eastern Zaire, the overall situation is still volatile.  While many Zaireans are still reportedly away from their places of residences, there are also reports that those inside are relatively pleased with the disappearance of the undisciplined Zairean soldiers noted for looting, raping, etc. How long the situation is to remain as it is will be seen in the weeks to come.  Overall Damage caused by the event: Quite a large number of people are reported killed in Lemera, Bukavu, Chimanga, Mugunga, Goma and other places. Killings have been reported in refugee camps as well as in the hospitals. Some children and elderly are also feared dead while trying to flea the advance of both the rebels and the fleeing soldiers. In addition, lack of food and medicine must have also contributed to the death of quite many. Unfortunately, to date, no one has as such compiled the data on the atrocities. But estimates are that it can be quite high. At the initial phase, overall, the turn of events in Eastern Zaire might have affected about a million Rwandese refugees and, perhaps, about the same number of Zaireans who have been forced to flee the hills and other areas. As some 65,000 refugees have reportedly returned back to Rwanda and some displaced Zaireans are also reported to have returned, perhaps, at the moment, one can think of some 300,000 Rwandese refugees in Eastern Zaire and, perhaps, about 200,000 Zarian IDP'S. Assuring an average family size of five, the total can be about 100,000 household or families. With the situation in Eastern Zaire, figures have continued to remain controversial. Even with satellite and other complex means, no one has been able to come up with acceptable figures as related to the number of Rwandese refugees still in Zaire and also the IDPs.  One thing is certain - that quite a large number of Zaireans have been victims of the situation. The combination of the rebel uprising and the aftermath of the fleeing Zairean soldiers has forced many to leave their homes and farms and run away for safety and security. In addition to farms, hospitals and schools have also been looted and destroyed. Many dispensaries are reported to be without any medicine. In some cases, health personnel have also been forced to flee, thus adding to the magnitude of the problem.  Implementing Partner: CEPZa and CELPa churches are perhaps the main evangelical churches in the Kivu region, with substantial membership and well-established structures. These two churches affiliated with the Swedish and Norwegian Pentecostal churches respectively have proven their ability to be viable partners during the ACT/NCA Assistance programme for the Rwandese refugees in the Bukavu and Uvira areas. They run schools and a number of dispensaries and hospitals.  Location: The ACT Kisangani Emergency Assistance Programme will operate from a coordination office in Kisangani, Zaire. The main area of operation will be Lubuto and, to a lesser extent, Kachungu -- both in North Kivu. Kisangani is a major city with an international airport and the Zaire river, which is the main transportation and communication link between Eastern Zaire and Kinshasa.  Lubuto is located 244 kms away from Kisangani on a dirt road accessible only by sturdy trucks and four-wheel drive vehicles.  Lubuto has a landing strip for small aircraft. There is a larger landing strip some distance away between Lubuto and Walikali at Amisi, where DC-3's, Fokker and Buffalo can land.  As things changed dramatically in Kivu, the Walikali-Lubuto-Kisangani route was used by the fleeing Zairean soldiers who have been the major cause of looting and displacement of the local population, The Walikali-Lubuto area currently has a large number of Rwandese refugees (possibly including some Interhamwe and ex-FAR) and locally displaced Zaireans. They are reported to be in desperate condition and in need of assistance both with food and medical attention. Targeted beneficiaries of this particular appeal: The beneficiaries will be 40,000 Rwandese refugees and 10,000 Zairean displaced (IDPs) in Lubuto. Children, women and the elderly will be given priority, in addition, a hospital in Katchungu will be supported with medicine to assist the refugees and the IDPs in its location. Stated Needs: The main assistance package will be health and supplementary food for the malnourished children.The details will be:  1.Basic medicine will be needed to give medical service to 50,000 persons for three months. 2.Medical team of doctors and nurses to coordinate medical assistance to hospitals and  dispensaries. 3.Supplementary food such as high protein biscuits and other food items to be locally purchased and distributed. 4.Setting up shelter tents and supply of sheeting to the dispensaries. 5.Setting up a Coordination team: five in Kisangani and another team of Kisangani which could be attached to the church structures in Lubuto. Procurement: 1.Basic food such as rice, beans; and palm oil will be purchased locally. 2.Medicine and supplementary food will be procured regionally and internationally.  Implementation Timetable: 1 January to 31 March 1997. Coordination: The Kisangani activities have so far been carried out in close cooperation and coordination between ACT members NCA and LWF in Nairobi, as well as FMU from Sweden, Humedica from Germany and MAF office in Nairobi. Other ACT members such as Christian Aid and Diakonishes Werk have also been active participants in the Nairobi-based ACT coordination mechanism. The envisaged operation will be a continuation of the emergency programme already underway with support mainly from NCA/MFA, PMU and Humedica. In the current Zairean situation, the coordinating role of the government is minimal, although CEPZA-CELPA has official permission from the Deputy PM and the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Zaire to implement the ACT Kisangani Emergency Assistance program. ACT/NCA reports that UNICEF and others are working through ACT as it is the only Network to have official authorization to operate in the Kisangani area.  Through their concerted coordination effort and exemplary spirit of cooperation and goodwill, ACT members in Nairobi have been able to mobilize considerable financial, material and human resources on the spot. Thanks to this kind of coordination, ACT was the first to dispatch a reconnaissance team to the Lubuto-Walikali-Bunia area and the first to reach Lubuto with basic medicine and food. IIIACT/DIA/ECZ Local Partners: ECZ North Kivu: the Eglise du Christ au Zaire, North Kivu, is a conglomerate of 12 member churches in the Goma region, that work together. It has experience with development and relief activities in the region, amongst others distribution of relief items to the Rwandan Refugees in Kibumba camp, supported by Christian Aid/ODA. At this moment about one third of goma-Town population is displaced, out in the rural areas (about 70,000 people). It is estimated that an additional 100,000 people had fled Masisi and Ruhutsuru, before the recent war. Furthermore, it is estimated that an additional 50,000 people have been displaced from other areas. Some of the displaced can return to their areas, because they are relatively safe now. For others (e.g. from Masisi) it might take some time. Other people have not been displaced but have suffered a lot because of the presence of the refugees, or because they host many displaced family members. All need support, in order to regain their life, or to survive being displaced. The estimation of the numbers given above is very rough and as such can be criticized. (It is based on some samples and many discussions)  The total duration of the project is 3 months.  Organisation: The implementing agency is ECZ Goma. ECZ will be responsible for the management and execution of the project. Rev. A steering committee will take care that proper tendering procedures are followed (open bidding, opening of sealed bidding envelopes in presence of steering committee, at least three tenders). It will monitor distribution in the villages andin the hospitals. It will contact the pastors committees in all the benefitting villages and inform those committees on the quantities of relief items allocated to the villages. The steering committee will set criteria for the selection of the target group in the villages.  The pastors committees in the beneficiary villages are responsible for the selection of the beneficiaries, following the guidelines set by the steering committee. They take care of proper distribution, including the filling of the proper distribution forms. Each of the beneficiary villages has such a pastors committee, consisting of the representing pastors of the member churches of ECZ.  Traders will be invited to provide their tenders inclusive of the delivery of the items in the beneficiary villages. This excludes the necessity of arranging for stock in Goma town. The medical supplies will be provided by the traders directly to the CBK hospital.  The project will need mobilisers (in ECZ) to convince that part of the population that can return to their homes, to do that. The assistance is then a starting up stimulus. Furthermore, additional staff is needed (in ECZ) to monitor the work in the villages and to administer the project centrally.  Rev. Masimango Katanda has been elected Bishop in Kindu. Once the project starts he is available on a consultancy basis to assist the project in its starting up phase (1 month).  IVACT/NCA Enmergency Assistance Programme, Bukavu, ZAIRE Request From: ACT - NCA lmplementing Partner: CEFZa and CELPa churches in the regions of South and North Kivu are quite prominent and well established. These two churches affiliated to the Swedish and Norwegian Pentecostal churches respectively have proven their ability to be viable partners during the ACT/NCA Assistance programme for the Rwandese refugees in the Bukavu and Uvira areas.  As implementing partners in the area of Bukavu where ACT/NCA was a lead agency, these churches have not only proven their ability to handle responsibilities, but they enjoyed confidence of and respect the UNHCR, WFP and several others Involved in the programe to assist the Rwandese refugees in the area. The now defunct Bukavu-based CEPZa/CELPa Assistance Programme for Rwandese Refugees was one of the leading local Zairean structures to deal with the emergency work by then and with quite a positive reputation. Current Emergency: Following the rebel uprising in Kivu, quite a large part of Eastern Zaire has come under the control of the Banyamulenge and their Allied Force. This has apparently resulted in a major displacement of local Zairean population. Many residents of Bukavu, Uvira and Goma towns have been forced to fleed for their safety and security. Even the farmers in tliia area were reported to have been forced to flee. Some had just to run up to the hills and others to far distances. With the collapse of the local government strcucture for now and with the take over by the rebel group, even some church leaders are reported to have, at least, temporarily to have left their areas. Many church structures, schools and dispensaries have either been looted or destroyed. Unfortunately, instead of guaranteeing security and safety for the people, the fleeing Zairean soldiers have been additional source of discomfort forcing many to flee. Location: ACT/NCA Emergency Assistance Programme will be based in Bukavu, in South Kivu, Zaire. Bukavu is the capital city of South Kivu with all major structure and with a large population.  With the advance of the rebels who have now made Bukavu their capital, there was serious confrontation in Bukavu and some casualties have also been reported.  Although it is now closed, Bukavu has a modern airport. With ineffective local government and corruption at its peak, long before the advance of the rebel force, Bukavu was without vital services such as postal and banking services. As there was no salary, government schools have been non- functional for over a year. This region, among others, has the Lemera and Kaziba hospitals which were run by CEPZa and CELPa respectively. Unfortunately, Lemera was the first location where serious massacre took place inside the hospital and it has been destroyed and looted. Currently, the area is reportedly used as a military training centre for the rebel force. Targeted beneficiaries: The beneficiaries of the Bukavu-based ACT/NCA Emergency Assistance Programme will be about 100,000 Zaireans attached to some 15 dispensaries an the Bukavu-Bideka- Izriangabo as well as Bukavu-Nyangezi-Uvira stretches. The vulnerable groups such as children, women and the elderly will be given priority. In addition to the health component, some 4,000 farm household will also be supported with agricultural seeds and tools. Stated Needs: 1. Medicines and basic medical equipments 2. Agricultural seeds and tools 3. If conditions allow, assist in the distribution of f ood. Procurement: 1.Medicine and supplementary food will be procured regionally and internationally. 2.Agricultural seeds and tools will be procured locally and regionally. Implementation Timetable: 1 January to 31 March 1997. Coordination: In the current zairean situation, the coordinating role of the government is minimal. Nonetheless, as far as ACTINCA Bukavu Progrwoo is concerned, it will be more and more the responsibility of the local churches. The project office will play a facilitation role and will keep close and cordial contacts and relations with all the concerned.  The Bukavu project will be coordinated from the NCA Nairobi office which will also be responsible for all the accounts.

The ACT  network is organizationally based in the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) and the World Council of Churches(WCC) and is a co-ordinating rather than operational office. Geneva, December 20, 1996  War in North and South Kivu has led to the displacement of thousands of Zaireans. Many are wounded, have lost their homes and property, or are dead. The Kivu Region of Eastern Zaire has long been neglected by its national government , completely cut off from development opportunities and resources. The recent upheaval has been set against a backdrop of dilapidated or nonexistent infrastructure, making those fleeing all the more vulnerable. In addition, Zairean currency has become almost obsolete in this region and the rural exodus has affected the economic base of the countryside. The recent ACT Assessment Mission to the region has confirmed that, in order to help these people to regain some level of stability in their lives, we as a Network should concentrate on:  - providing immediate medical and food assistance to the displaced and refugees  - convincing people to go home by assisting them to resume their normal activities It is also time to assist our local implementing partners to get back on their feet, as is witnessed by the following Appeal. I  ACT/CA - Humanitarian Aid for Zairian Displaced Component Following the advance of the rebel movement, the ""Alliance Démocratique pour la Libération du Congo-Zaire"" (ADLC), through South Kivu, tens of thousands of Zairians fled from their homes in Bukavu and nearby villages and took refuge in the surrounding mountainous areas. The more isolated villages were considered to be safer than the towns as they were not of strategic interest to the opposing forces. Despite the relative calm in Bukavu since the capture of the town from the hands of the Zairian Armed Forces (FAZ), the vast majority of displaced prefer to stay in the villages, fearing a counter-attack on the part of the FAZ.  ACT/Christian Aid staff in South Kivu have carried out a survey in the zone of Walungu, approximately 50km to the South West of Bukavu, which shows that the population in villages in the area has more than quadrupled. The ACT Assessment Mission to South Kivu confirmed these figures. No camps have been created, but living conditions are extremely overcrowded. Partners returning from other zones of South Kivu have spoken of similar problems.  Perhaps the gravest problem at the moment, however, is the food situation in the region. The permanent inhabitants of the villages are subsistence farmers, having lost the incentive to produce surplus stocks due to lack of access to markets over recent years (poor roads and high military road ""taxes"" leading to a huge drop in the number of vehicles reaching remote areas). Food which would normally feed one family, therefore, is now feeding 4 families. ACT/Christian Aid has supported Zairean churches and NGOs in the Bukavu region of Eastern Zaire for the past 10 years. ACT/Christian Aid will coordinate relief activities for 4000 displaced families, with delivery and distribution of food and non-food items carried out by the following local partners:  Pain pour les déshérités (PLD) -- Has provided emergency assistance to Rwandan refugees and credit to Zaireans repatriated from Rwanda. ASOP/CDI -- An NGO active in erosion prevention, agroforestry, supply of seeds and credit. SOCOPS -- This NGO organizes training and cooperation through credit programs in agriculture. UDAC -- An NGO which provides health insurance. Eglise du Christ au Zaire -- Active throughout North/South Kivu in relief distribution. ACT/CA will manage the project (admin, procurement, logistics, financial reporting etc.), while the above-mentioned local partner organisations will organise committees of displaced people and carry out the distributions. Some food stocks are already available for purchase in Bukavu - all purchases will be made locally or in the region. Trucks for transporting goods into the villages housing displaced are available. Distributions will be made per family, based on an average of 5 persons per family. Each family will receive a month's supply of rice, maize, beans, palm oil, salt, soap and blankets. It is hoped that the time period of one month for this project will be enough to keep hunger at bay while allowing the displaced to readjust to the political realities of the area. The project will be implemented in coordination with other NGO and UN agency programmes in the area.  Since the ACT/CA office lost its vehicle during the fighting, the cost of a 4WD pick-up for use in distributions will also be included in the budget as will the wages for 2 additional local staff who will work for the ACT/CA office on a temporary basis for 6 months. Likewise, when organising the distributions, the partners of CA will need to employ experienced staff on a temporary basis to ensure distributions are carried out in an orderly fashion.

113,28703,[12033],Mine Action,Princess Diana arrives in Angola for landmine campaign,"By Lesley Wroughton LUANDA, Jan 13 (Reuter) - Britain's Princess Diana arrived in the Angolan capital Luanda on Monday as part of a four-day private visit to boost a Red Cross campaign to ban the use of landmines. Diana arrived at around 7.30 GMT aboard a scheduled Sabena flight and was greeted by British Ambassador to Angola Roger Hart and senior officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation of the Red Cross helping to oversee her visit. The princess was the first person to step from the plane after a delay caused when airport officials had difficulty fitting the steps. The glamorous princess, who once said she wanted to be the ''queen of people's hearts,'' was casually dressed in blue jeans, a navy jacket and sneakers. Her arrival was low-key with only a handful of Angolans working at the airport looking on at the hordes of journalists covering the trip. The princess, who usually travels with a large entourage, arrived in Angola from London with just a butler and two bodyguards. In a brief address to reporters, Diana said her visit was aimed at helping the Red Cross in its campaign to ban landmines. ''There couldn't be a more appropriate place to begin a campaign than Angola because this nation has the highest number of amputees per population anywhere in the world. The current statistics stand at one amputee per 334 inhabitants,'' she said. ''This statistic alone is reason enough for why the international community must work together to help ban landmines,'' Diana told reporters. After her address she was taken to the official British residence in Luanda's central city before being briefed at the ICRC offices on the Angolan situation. En route to the high-security residence, the princess passed hundreds of tin shanties where some of Luanda's poorest live. Diana will be hosted at a dinner by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos on Monday night. On Tuesday she will visit local Red Cross health posts and landmine training centres as well as an orthopaedic centre. The following day Diana will travel by air to the central highlands capital of Huambo where she will see a demonstration of landmine lifting operations by the British-based Halo Trust.

114,28709,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Dateline ACT Great Lakes Region No.12,"DATELINE ACT Great lakes region No 12 ACTions in Great Lakes Region - January 1997 Geneva, January 13, 1997 With 1,300,582 people (UNHCR figure) returning to Rwanda since mid-November, much of ACT International's attention is now focused on assisting returnees in their home Prefectures in Rwanda i.e. provision of temporary shelter or permanent housing, distribution of food and non-food items. While ACT is busy through partners inside Rwanda, ACT members continue working with the remaining Burundian refugees in Tanzania as well as reaching out with assistance to some of the hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees and Zairian displaced in parts of Eastern Zaire. Eastern Zaire - assisting refugees and displaced Major concentrations of refugees and displaced in government controlled parts of Eastern Zaire have been identified in three places: Shabunda (25.000), Lubutu/Tingi-Tingi and Amisi (together approximately 160.000). These figures are World Food Programme (WFP) estimates - note though that none of these figures are based on systematic counting but are estimates based on observations on the ground. And while some aid workers express concern over the unusually high percentages of young men amongst the refugees remaining in Eastern Zaire others point to the deteriorating health condition of some of refugees. At Tingi-Tingi for instance 810 malnourished children are in special feeding programmes. Shabunda was left by the ICRC on December 24, 1996 and information about the situation there has been scarce ever since. In cooperation with the WFP ACT members (Norwegian Church Aid and local partners) are flying, trucking and distributing food and non-food items (mainly medicine) to displaced in Lubutu and Kisangani as well as refugees at Tingi-Tingi and Masisi. Despite very difficult conditions on the ground ACT members have distributed more than 150 tons of food and medicine in these parts of Eastern Zaire. On top of this ACT is distributing relief items on behalf of WFP in Kisangani and Tingi-Tingi. In both Bukavu and Goma areas, controlled by the Alliance for Democracy in Congo-Zaire (ADF), ACT member Christian Aid are working with local churches (among them the Eglise du Christ au Zaire) and NGO's to (re-)establish emergency and rehabilitation projects for the Zairian population affected by the war and turmoil in the region since September/October of 1996. For instance thousands of families fled Bukavu and Goma during the conflict in and around these and other major towns in Eastern Zaire. Many still remain in overcrowded villages living with families and friends. ACT plans to assist the displaced with badly needed food and non-food items in order for them to regain enough strength and confidence to return to their homes. In the Bukavu area local and international ACT members are working together to reestablish basic medical services to about 100.000 citizens. Another 4.000 families will be supported with agricultural seeds and tools. ACT members in Eastern Zaire are coordinating their activities at both the local level and in Nairobi, Kenya. Rwanda - large scale shelter, housing and reconstruction ACT members are working towards assisting returning refugees and their receiving communities across Rwanda. Covered by ACT International appeals of late 1996 local and international ACT members are putting a high emphasis on shelter and housing programmes as this is seen as a priority area by the homeless families as well as a prerequisite for lessening the tension between Tutsis and Hutus, between those who fled and those who stayed after the genocide in 1994 and thus eventually a contribution to stability and reconciliation in the larger society.  Apart from providing plastic and blankets for thousands in need of temporary shelter ACT member Lutheran World Federation (LWF) is for instance in Eastern Rwanda (Kibungo & Umutara) planning to build or reconstruct 4,500 family houses benefitting an estimated 37.500 people. The construction cost of an average rural house in Rwanda is estimated to be between USD 1,000 to 1,200. All building materials are purchased locally or regionally if possible and the construction of the houses relies heavily on people themselves taking part in the work serving a double purpose of both creating housing and providing some people with additional skills. In Western Rwanda similar activities are going on in Kibuye and Gitarama Prefectures along with continued distribution of food and non-food items in 13 districts. All in all the programme in Western Rwanda aims at benefitting 120.000 people and are balanced between the needs of returnees from Zaire and the population who stayed in Rwanda after the 1994 genocide. To support these and other projects ACT/LWF is running nine warehouses across Rwanda in addition to a substantial transportation fleet. ACT/NCA in cooperation with the Conseil Protestant du Rwanda (CPR) have shipped 60 tons of blankets and plastic sheeting for immediate distribution to returnees as well as having started a shelter project with 200 houses in Kibungo- Mukarango with local NGO. ACT partner Eglise Episcopale au Rwanda (EER) in cooperation with Christian Aid are planning a shelter programme for 2,700 households in two communes in the Diocese of Byumba as well as distributing 4,000 kitchen sets in the communes. ACT partners present in Rwanda co-ordinate their activities through a newly established ACT Forum, chaired by Karin Gezelius of ACT/Church of Sweden Aid. This co-ordination includes CPR (eight local church representatives), LWF, UMCOR, Church World Service, Christian Aid & the Salvation Army. Tanzania - Burundian refugees still arriving In Tanzania ACT/TCRS is responsible for the camp management for approximately 70.000 Burundian refugees at Mtendeli camp. According to UNHCR there are currently 239.000 Burundian refugees in Ngara, Kibondo and Kasulu districts of Tanzania with about 600 new arrivals daily. It is likely that close to 90.000 of the Burundian refugees will be moved in the near future from camps around Ngara to the camp at Lumasi left empty by Rwandan refugees in December, 1996. ACT/TCRS have been asked to assist UNHCR in transportation of these refugees. Burundi Relief items on hold at border With the civil conflict continuing in many parts of Burundi ACT/Christian Aid along with a number of local churches in Burundi are eagerly awaiting the arrival of seven truckloads of non-food relief items (blankets, plastic sheeting, jerry cans, soap etc). The relief goods are currently held up at the Tanzanian-Burundian border awaiting clearance from the local Tanzanian authorities that oversees the trade embargo on Burundi. Once in Burundi the relief items are to be distributed by local churches to displaced and other needy groups throughout 13 of Burundi's 16 regions. Funding for Great Lakes Region appeals so far Since the latest escalation of the crisis in the Great Lakes Region began in September/October of 1996 ACT International has issued five appeals to fundraise for relief operations aimed at meeting the expanding and changing humanitarian needs in the region. The three first appeals (AFZR61-63) totaled USD 14,620,897 and they are so far covered up to USD 6,260,854 (43%) by ACT funding members and their back donors. The last two appeals (AFZR64 & AFRW61) totaling USD 4,828,328 were issued just before Christmas 1996 and have so far not been funded. As the above described programmes and activities depend on funding responses, ACT International are asking all funding members and their back donors as soon as possible to pledge against these apparent needs. Crucial programmes are in danger of coming to a halt if funding is not found. This will have obvious and serious consequences for the beneficiaries through out the Great Lakes Region.

115,28838,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Great Lakes Region: Appeal and financial report,"Great Lakes Region: Financial Report [ACT-05: 20-Jan-97] Action by Churches Together (ACT) Financial Update no. 5  GLR Zaire/Rwanda Appeals  Geneva, January 20, 1997 Since the last Financial Update No. 4, dated 19 December 1996, two further appeals, both dated December 20, 1996, have been issued, which we trust you have received by now. They are:  * AFZR64 - Humanitarian Assistance to North & South Kivu, E. Zaire - USD 1,993,367 * AFRW61 - Humanitarian Assistance to Rwandan Returnees, Rwanda - USD 2,834,961 While heralding hopes for an end to the suffering of nearly 2 million refugees and IDPs, the changing scenarios have also posed fresh challenges due to the expanding and changing humanitarian needs of the returnees. Hence the two new Appeals just before Christmas.  The 5 Appeals issued for the Great Lakes Rregion (GLR) between October 23 and December 20 for approximately USD 19.5 million, underscore the ACT Network's preparedness and ability to respond and deal effectively even with complex emergencies, such as the GLR crisis.  These efforts however, are greatly strengthened by the involvement and participation of our partners on the ground. Hence, a major challenge to the network would be to find ways and means to express support to the growing number of Implementing Partners (IPs), especially the local churches. These local churches and other local partners figure prominently in the two most recent appeals, and need to get back on their feet to provide services to their communities.  While the first 3 appeals have been covered upto 44% by the Network, the remainder being backdonor applications, the two more recent ones (issued 20 December 1996) are yet to be adequately funded. The USD 500,000 budgeted for Regional Coordination and Support to Local Churches in AFZR63, has received USD 75,692 (15 %) only, to date.

Great Lakes Region: Humanitarian [ACT-12: 13-Jan-97] Action by Churches Together (ACT) DATELINE ACT  Great Lakes Region No 12  ACTions in Great Lakes Region - January 1997  Geneva, January 13, 1997 With 1,300,582 people (UNHCR figure) returning to Rwanda since mid-November, much of ACT International's attention is now focused on assisting returnees in their home Prefectures in Rwanda i.e. provision of temporary shelter or permanent housing, distribution of food and non-food items. While ACT is busy through partners inside Rwanda, ACT members continue working with the remaining Burundian refugees in Tanzania as well as reaching out with assistance to some of the hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees and Zairian displaced in parts of Eastern Zaire.  Eastern Zaire - assisting refugees and displaced Major concentrations of refugees and displaced in government controlled parts of Eastern Zaire have been identified in three places: Shabunda (25.000), Lubutu/Tingi-Tingi and Amisi (together approximately 160.000). These figures are World Food Programme (WFP) estimates - note though that none of these figures are based on systematic counting but are estimates based on observations on the ground. And while some aid workers express concern over the unusually high percentages of young men amongst the refugees remaining in Eastern Zaire others point to the deteriorating health condition of some of refugees. At Tingi-Tingi for instance 810 malnourished children are in special feeding programmes. Shabunda was left by the ICRC on December 24, 1996 and information about the situation there has been scarce ever since. In cooperation with the WFP ACT members (Norwegian Church Aid and local partners) are flying, trucking and distributing food and non-food items (mainly medicine) to displaced in Lubutu and Kisangani as well as refugees at Tingi-Tingi and Masisi. Despite very difficult conditions on the ground ACT members have distributed more than 150 tons of food and medicine in these parts of Eastern Zaire. On top of this ACT is distributing relief items on behalf of WFP in Kisangani and Tingi-Tingi.  In both Bukavu and Goma areas, controlled by the Alliance for Democracy in Congo-Zaire (ADF), ACT member Christian Aid are working with local churches (among them the Eglise du Christ au Zaire) and NGO's to (re-)establish emergency and rehabilitation projects for the Zairian population affected by the war and turmoil in the region since September/October of 1996. For instance thousands of families fled Bukavu and Goma during the conflict in and around these and other major towns in Eastern Zaire. Many still remain in overcrowded villages living with families and friends. ACT plans to assist the displaced with badly needed food and non-food items in order for them to regain enough strength and confidence to return to their homes. In the Bukavu area local and international ACT members are working together to reestablish basic medical services to about 100.000 citizens. Another 4.000 families will be supported with agricultural seeds and tools. ACT members in Eastern Zaire are coordinating their activities at both the local level and in Nairobi,Kenya.  Rwanda Large scale shelter, housing and reconstruction ACT members are working towards assisting returning refugees and their receiving communities across Rwanda. Covered by ACT International appeals of late 1996 local and international ACT members are putting a high emphasis on shelter and housing programmes as this is seen as a priority area by the homeless families as well as a prerequisite for lessening the tension between Tutsis and Hutus, between those who fled and those who stayed after the genocide in 1994 and thus eventually a contribution to stability and reconciliation in the larger society.  Apart from providing plastic and blankets for thousands in need of temporary shelter ACT member Lutheran World Federation (LWF) is for instance in Eastern Rwanda (Kibungo & Umutara) planning to build or reconstruct 4,500 family houses benefitting an estimated 37.500 people. The construction cost of an average rural house in Rwanda is estimated to be between USD 1,000 to 1,200. All building materials are purchased locally or regionally if possible and the construction of the houses relies heavily on people themselves taking part in the work serving a double purpose of both creating housing and providing some people with additional skills.  In Western Rwanda similar activities are going on in Kibuye and Gitarama Prefectures along with continued distribution of food and non-food items in 13 districts. All in all the programme in Western Rwanda aims at benefitting 120.000 people and are balanced between the needs of returnees from Zaire and the population who stayed in Rwanda after the 1994 genocide. To support these and other projects ACT/LWF is running nine warehouses across Rwanda in addition to a substantial transportation fleet. ACT/NCA in cooperation with the Conseil Protestant du Rwanda (CPR) have shipped 60 tons of blankets and plastic sheeting for immediate distribution to returnees as well as having started a shelter project with 200 houses in Kibungo- Mukarango with local NGO. ACT partner Eglise Episcopale au Rwanda (EER) in cooperation with Christian Aid are planning a shelter programme for 2,700 households in two communes in the Diocese of Byumba as well as distributing 4,000 kitchen sets in the communes.  ACT partners present in Rwanda co-ordinate their activities through a newly established ACT Forum, chaired by Karin Gezelius of ACT/Church of Sweden Aid. This co-ordination includes CPR (eight local church representatives), LWF, UMCOR, Church World Service, Christian Aid & the Salvation Army.   Tanzania Burundian refugees still arriving In Tanzania ACT/TCRS is responsible for the camp management for approximately 70.000 Burundian refugees at Mtendeli camp. According to UNHCR there are currently 239.000 Burundian refugees in Ngara, Kibondo and Kasulu districts of Tanzania with about 600 new arrivals daily.  It is likely that close to 90.000 of the Burundian refugees will be moved in the near future from camps around Ngara to the camp at Lumasi left empty by Rwandan refugees in December, 1996. ACT/TCRS have been asked to assist UNHCR in transportation of these refugees.  Burundi Relief items on hold at border With the civil conflict continuing in many parts of Burundi ACT/Christian Aid along with a number of local churches in Burundi are eagerly awaiting the arrival of seven truckloads of non-food relief items (blankets, plastic sheeting, jerry cans, soap etc). The relief goods are currently held up at the Tanzanian-Burundian border awaiting clearance from the local Tanzanian authorities that oversees the trade embargo on Burundi. Once in Burundi the relief items are to be distributed by local churches to displaced and other needy groups throughout 13 of Burundi's 16 regions.  Funding for Great Lakes Region appeals so far  Since the latest escalation of the crisis in the Great Lakes Region began in September/October of 1996 ACT International has issued five appeals to fundraise for relief operations aimed at meeting the expanding and changing humanitarian needs in the region. The three first appeals (AFZR61-63) totaled USD 14,620,897 and they are so far covered up to USD 6,260,854 (43%) by ACT funding members and their back donors. The last two appeals (AFZR64 & AFRW61) totaling USD 4,828,328 were issued just before Christmas 1996 and have so far not been funded.  As the above described programmes and activities depend on funding responses, ACT International are asking all funding members and their back donors as soon as possible to pledge against these apparent needs. Crucial programmes are in danger of coming to a halt if funding is not found. This will have obvious and serious consequences for the beneficiaries through out the Great Lakes Region.

They are:  * AFZR64 - Humanitarian Assistance to North & South Kivu, E. Zaire - USD 1,993,367 * AFRW61 - Humanitarian Assistance to Rwandan Returnees, Rwanda - USD 2,834,961 While heralding hopes for an end to the suffering of nearly 2 million refugees and IDPs, the changing scenarios have also posed fresh challenges due to the expanding and changing humanitarian needs of the returnees. Hence the two new Appeals just before Christmas.  The 5 Appeals issued for the Great Lakes Rregion (GLR) between October 23 and December 20 for approximately USD 19.5 million, underscore the ACT Network's preparedness and ability to respond and deal effectively even with complex emergencies, such as the GLR crisis.  These efforts however, are greatly strengthened by the involvement and participation of our partners on the ground. Hence, a major challenge to the network would be to find ways and means to express support to the growing number of Implementing Partners (IPs), especially the local churches. These local churches and other local partners figure prominently in the two most recent appeals, and need to get back on their feet to provide services to their communities.  While the first 3 appeals have been covered upto 44% by the Network, the remainder being backdonor applications, the two more recent ones (issued 20 December 1996) are yet to be adequately funded. The USD 500,000 budgeted for Regional Coordination and Support to Local Churches in AFZR63, has received USD 75,692 (15 %) only, to date.  The slowdown in contributions and pledges over the holiday season, is a matter of growing concern which we place before you. The following summaries reflect the current funding status.

118,29047,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Rwandan and Burundian refugees Situation Report No. 2,"BURUNDI, RWANDA, TANZANIA, UGANDA & ZAIRE:  emergency appeal no. 19/96 period covered: 1 October - 31 December 1996 Summary The Red Cross Societies of Zaire, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda aided by the International Federation, had to contend with three months of arduous, confusing and often incomprehensible happenings during the reporting period. Camps once known as ""the largest refugee camps in the world"" simply ceased to exist, as their inhabitants fled for their lives due to fighting, or made the long, difficult march back home . By the end of the year, some 1.3 million Rwandans were back in their home communes, facing a difficult future in a country still beset by ethnic tensions. Eastern Zaire, previously populated by hundreds of thousands of refugees had become a conflict zone from which scores of thousands fled westwards into dense bush, resurfacing weeks later, in a weary condition, unable or unwilling to get back to Rwanda. Many thousands of Burundian refugees still live in Federation-run camps in Rwanda and Tanzania, avoiding conflict in their strife-torn country. The context This situation report aims to summarise the response of the International Federation and its member National Societies to the rapidly-changing and often chaotic events caused by conflict and enormous population movements during the last three months of 1996 in the Great Lakes region of Africa. Latest events Long-standing disputes over nationality and land rights in Eastern Kivu, Zaire triggered a conflict between the so-called Banyamulenge rebels and the Zairean army at the start of October. In a series of advances, the rebels, joined by a variety of other groups, took control of a vast sector of Zairean territory - by the end of the year the coalition AFDL forces (Alliance des Forces Democratiques pour la Liberation du Congo-Zaire) ruled over a 100 kilometre-wide belt extending from Fizi in the south to Bunia in the north. The area was since mid 1994 home to over a million Rwandan and Burundian refugees. Fighting and insecurity led aid agencies to first reduce and then stop the assistance in the areas of Uvira, Bukavu and Goma. Massive population movements started , with over a quarter of a million people leaving the Uvira camps in the direction of Bukavu. Humanitarian agencies were also forced out by the fighting, and 110,000 refugees and IDPs were effectively lost in the jungle for several weeks. November and December 1996 saw the mass return to Rwanda of refugees from the camps in Zaire and Tanzania in two large and unexpected waves. The first movement, of 650,000 refugees from Kivu put enormous strain on the coping capacities of local communities and aid agencies. Energetically driven by the government of Rwanda, the return of the refugees to their home communes was completed in three weeks. The repatriation of 480,000 from Tanzania, announced with some notice, found aid agencies better prepared. By the end of the year, over 1,300,000 people had come back to Rwanda, creating a wide set of opportunities for and threats to the reconstruction of Rwandan society. The almost constant influx of Burundian refugees into Tanzania saw some peaks during the last three months of the year, coinciding with waves of violence inside the troubled Central African country. At the same time the Kivu crisis spilled over to Tanzania, with tens of thousands of Zairean and Burundian refugees crossing lake Tanganyika into Kigoma. In Uganda, the Federation and Uganda Red Cross Society were running a smooth operation for a relatively limited number of Rwandan refugees in the camps of Orukinga and Nakivale up to mid-November, when hostilities between Zaire-backed rebels and Ugandan troops flared in the south-west of the country. This led to the displacement of tens of thousands of civilians in and around Kasese. Insecurity continued for the following weeks, with clashes spreading across the border into Zaire. Meanwhile, thousands of refugees poured into Uganda from the same area of eastern Zaire, fleeing clashes between Banyamulenge rebels and the Zairean army. The area around Mbarara was affected at the beginning of December when Rwandan refugees, refusing to repatriate from Tanzania, started crossing into Uganda. At the end of the month, about 3,500 were being cared for by the Federation and Uganda Red Cross. Red Cross/Red Crescent action Tanzania The repatriation exercise lasted for 16 days. Red Cross action during that time consisted of the immediate establishment of way stations where first aid and other basic health services were offered. In addition, a water production plant was established close to the border from which 1.7 million litres were transported by Red Cross tankers to OXFAM water points. During the first week of December, Tanzania Red Cross and the Federation were asked to take over camp management and health activities in the Moyovosi camp for Burundian refugees, in the Kigoma region. Extra efforts were required during the month, as a number of camp management procedures had to be put into place from scratch. Also, a malaria epidemic was taking a severe toll. While activities in the Lukole camps continued throughout the reporting period, including camp management, preventive and curative health care and the distribution of approximately 400 MT of food per month, assistance in Benaco came to an abrupt halt when the camp emptied due to repatriation. During the last three months of 1996, food distributions included 4,714 MT of maize grain, 1,410 MT of beans, 143.1 MT of CSB and 266 MT of vegetable oil. Non food aid mainly consisted of soap, 54.8 MT of which were distributed in Benaco. The Referral Hospital gave 2,768 consultations to OPD patients and 1,184 patients were admitted as in-patients. Zaire  Operations in Goma and Bukavu, where the Federation and Zairian Red Cross were distributing an average of almost 5,000 MT of food per month, came to a sudden end in October because of the Kivu conflict. Before the end of the month both sub-Delegations had to be evacuated, leaving the National Society to the grim task of collecting the bodies of conflict victims. In mid-November, the ICRC resumed some of its activities. Burundi Since the end of August, with the departure of virtually all Rwandan refugees from Burundi, activities have been reoriented towards assistance to the most vulnerable groups (unaccompanied children, pregnant women, widows, single-headed families, elderly, handicapped) in the areas where the situation permits the Burundi Red Cross to operate (Bujumbura ville, Ngozi, Kayanza, Kirundo and Muyinga). The target population is estimated at 80,000, scattered in 65 temporary shelters in 34 communes. Vulnerable groups have received timely distributions of non-food items (blankets, plastic sheeting and soap). In addition, the Federation and Burundi Red Cross are engaged in the following activities:  assistance to approximately 1,500 Rwandan refugees and Burundian returnees settled in the camps of Magara and Rukuramigabo; social programmes and distribution of warm meals to 100 street children in Ngozi; non-food assistance to various institutions (orphanages, handicapped centres); distribution of food and firewood to 400 Zairean refugees at Gihanga camp, near Bujumbura; camp management and food/non-food distributions for the Gatumba transit camp, hosting Burundian returnees from Zaire (15,000 at peak in November, around 1,500 by the end of the year); camp management and food/non-food distributions in the small settlement of Maramwa, which recently saw the influx of a few hundred displaced in a serious state of malnutrition.Rwanda At the beginning of October, the Rwanda Delegation started reinforcing itself in anticipation of forthcoming needs. The logistics, health and relief departments were strengthened, two sub-Delegations were set up and both the vehicle fleet and the telecommunications system were upgraded thanks to various donations. At the onset of the emergency, the Japanese, German and Danish Red Cross responded with the deployment of emergency Response Units. Thanks to the generous contribution of the Swedish government, an air bridge (over 30 rotations) was established with the Operations Support Unit in Nairobi to deliver needed commodities to Kigali. During the actual repatriation, the Rwanda Red Cross with the assistance of the Federation set up tens of assistance points, including first aid, water and emergency food distribution (over 10 MT of high protein biscuits). Special sites were built overnight to host the most vulnerable, operated for 72 to 96 hours, then dismantled and re-built in other locations to follow the immense flow of people. As soon as the returnees started to arrive in their communes, food and non-food distributions were started to facilitate their re-insertion:    Beneficiaries  Maize (MT)  Peas (MT)  Oil (MT)  Salt (MT)  Gisenyi  43,892      324.5  97.3  16.2  0  Ruhengeri  19,130 229.5 68.90 11.5  0  Kigali rural  22,581 277  78.2 13.69  2.8  Kigali ville 3,736  46.4 13.9 2.7  0.7  Mutara 6,296 78.6  22.6  0 0.2      Beneficiaries  Soap  Jerry cans  Mats Blankets Hoes  Kigali rural  7,352 7,554  3,228  0.00  4,477  4,547  Kigali ville  1,813  1,082  618  628 870 637  Mutara 1,700  0 1,700 0 0 0  Uganda Over the reporting period, The Federation/Uganda Red Cross distributed 369.3 MT of food and a variety of non-food items, including 770 blankets, 3,690 pieces of plastic sheeting and 408 jerry cans, to the camps of Orukinga and Nakivale. Orukinga dispensary, serving both refugees and local population, gave 9,169 consultations; while 4,811 consultations were given in Nakivale. Distributions in the Kisoro/Matanda area included over 196 MT of food, 2,793 pieces of plastic sheeting, 4,723 jerry cans and 2,248 kitchen sets. Contributions See Annex 1 for details. Conclusion An exhausting three months period for refugees, IDPs and humanitarians alike. The future is still uncertain, with the Great Lakes region subject to ongoing and deepening unrest. As this situation report was being compiled, the declaration of war by Zaire against rebel forces in the east of the country , coupled with the murder of three Spanish aid workers in Ruhengeri, Rwanda, cast renewed shadows on hopes for regional stability and access to the most v ulnerable. The International Federation is appealing for CHF 54.3 million to care for one million beneficiaries in 1997.

From 21 December, 1996 to 6 January, 1997 the United Nations Secretary- General dispatched an assessment mission to Sierra Leone to examine ways in which the UN could assist in the implementation of the Peace Accord signed on 30 November, 1996. Based on the assessment of the mission, the Secretary-General submitted his report on Sierra Leone to the Security Council on 28 January, 1997. The report summarises the military tasks of a possible peace-keeping operation as follows: monitoring and verifying the cease-fire, the withdrawal of foreign troops, the disarmament and demobilisation of RUF combatants, the withdrawal to barracks of RSLMF troops not required for normal security duties as well as helping the Government of Sierra Leone to develop a plan for their demobilisation. The military tasks would be completed within eight months of a Security Council decision to authorise the operation. The troop strength would not exceed 720, all ranks, including support elements. A total of 60 unarmed military observers would also be part of the proposed force. The Government of Sierra Leone is in favour of a peace-keeping force deployment of this size but the position of the RUF has not yet been clarified. It must also be stressed that these proposals have not yet been authorised by the Security Council.  SECURITY 2. On 21 January the kamajors recaptured Kailahun town, the most significant remaining RUF enclave in Sierra Leone. The fighting resulted in several casualties including one of the local leaders of the kamajors. It was also rumoured that the RUF battlefield commander Col. Tarawalle was killed. Wounded kamajors and civilians were transported to the hospitals in Segbwema and Kenema and an estimated influx of 1,000 displaced entered Daru. Initial reports that the RUF in Kailahun fled into Guinea and Liberia proved to be overstated as they subsequently succeeded in staging a successful comeback, regaining partial control of Kissy Kama, Kissy Teng, Kissy Tongi and Luawa chiefdoms.  3. On 22 January, 1997 the RUF leadership issued a press release stating that they believed that the Abidjan Peace Accord has been dashed aside by the Sierra Leone Government in favour of a military solution. The Government of Sierra Leone maintains that the kamajors infiltrated Kailahun district to help displaced civilians reclaim their agricultural land and that the kamajors role in the fighting was merely defensive. A joint UN-HACU/Food for Peace field trip to Pendembu immediately after the incident confirmed that the operation included kamajor representatives from Bo, Kenema and Kailahun districts. As Kailahun district is a region which is particularly rich in natural resources, it is expected that the area will remain unstable for the immediate future.  4. It is hoped that the implications of the violation of the Peace Accord in Kailahun are not too severe. The incident may have a negative impact on the potential demobilisation of the RUF still at large as it is unlikely that they will take Government offers of amnesty seriously. It is hoped that the Commission for the Consolidation of Peace might be able to rectify the situation through its current sensitisation mission upcountry. (See point 9 below).  5. From the date of the signing of the Peace Accord until mid-January, sporadic armed violence has also been reported in Tonkolili and Port Loko districts in the Northern Province and Moyamba district in the Southern Province. These security breaches have been motivated primarily by banditry and hunger. In Masimera chiefdom in Port Loko district armed elements have been harassing civilians since mid- December, which has caused returnees to remain in Lunsar instead of returning to their villages. See point 11, Sitrep dated 19 November-16 December for more details.  6. During the latter part of January 1997, security on the Freetown-Kenema highway has become increasingly problematic as two food transporters were ambushed on two different sections of the highway on 26 January. The first incident occurred between Masiaka and Mile 91. A passenger on the truck was killed but the driver, who was wounded, successfully managed to drive the truck to Bo. The five occupants of a taxi traveling in front of the truck were also killed. The second incident, which took place between Bo and Kenema, did not result in any casualties although damaged to the vehicle was sustained. These incidents are significant as this is the first time that armed elements have targeted vehicles on one of the major highways since the Peace Accord has been signed.  7. Conflict between the kamajors and the RSLMF continues to cause problems for the Government. On 26 January the two sides clashed at Mokanje in the Southern Province because the kamajors allegedly attempted to prevent the RSLMF from removing previously looted property on the latters withdrawal from the area. Two soldiers were killed and several kamajors were wounded.  8. Executive Outcomes (EO) has indicated that it will withdraw from Sierra Leone during the week beginning 3 February, 1996. POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 9. The Commission for the Consolidation of Peace (CCP), which comprises representatives from the Government of Sierra Leone and the RUF, has been meeting on a regular basis to discuss ways of implementing the Peace Accord. On 28 January, 1997 the CCP embarked on a tour of Bo, Kenema and Kailahun districts to impress on local people their commitment towards durable peace.  DEMOBILISATION 10. The Government of Sierra Leone, assisted by the UN and NGOs, has screened 1,300 suspected RUF ex-combatants/captives to date and only 200 were classified as ex-combatants in accordance with the Governments criteria. The vast majority of these RUF adherents have since been released. Those that have been correctly screened by the Government are eligible for assistance from relief agencies. Further progress on the demobilisation front has been hampered by the fact that the Demobilisation and Resettlement Committee, created on 30 December, 1996 in accordance with the provisions of the Abidjan Accord and comprising representatives from both the Government and the RUF, has not yet convened. This is because the RUF has not yet nominated its representatives for the Committee.  RESETTLEMENT 11. In spite of the incidents mentioned above, the security climate in many other former war-afflicted areas in the Eastern and Southern Provinces has improved. This state of affairs, coupled with the termination of general feeding programmes in camps and urban areas at the beginning of 1997, has prompted the resettlement of much of the displaced population. The encamped population is currently estimated to be 75,000-80,000 displaced compared with a total of approximately 210,000 at the height of the war. Although there are no reliable figures on the proportion of displaced living in towns who have returned home, recent surveys in Bo and Kenema estimated that 50 to 70 percent of non-camp, registered displaced had resettled. UN-HACU estimates that a total of 200,000 displaced have returned home by the end of January 1997. MNRRR, UN Agencies and NGOs have made a tremendous effort to sensitise the population to the possibilities of resettlement and have physically moved some of their service centres to the areas of origin of the returnees.  12. The resettlement of the 27,000 displaced living in the Freetown camp is more problematic as IDPs have demanded that the Government provide transport for their return. On 25 January MNRRR did successfully transport 1,100 camp residents in Freetown to their home areas in Bo, Kenema, Bonthe and Pujehun districts.  CAMP MANAGEMENT 13. On 2 and 3 January the camp residents of Clay Factory in the Western area rioted partly due to allegations of malpractice levied against the camp manager, EFSL. In response to these allegations, EFSL suspended all services provided to the camp. EFSL will resume providing services when it receives the go-ahead from the camp management committee and MNRRR.  14. There has been much discussion over the ultimate fate of the camp structures, latrines, clinics, etc. in camps throughout Sierra Leone when camp residents have returned tot heir areas of origin. Although MNRRR has decided that the camps should remain intact until at least March 1997, some shelters, particularly in Bo and Kenema, have already been dismantled. FOOD AID 15. The donor community will be channeling food through more agencies in Sierra Leone during 1997. In addition to WFP and CRS, World Vision, CARE, German Agro Action and Concern Universal will have their own direct food pipelines. The Committee on Food Aid will be instrumental in coordinating food strategy in the context of these additional pipelines. To this end, agreement has already been reached on determining which agency should be responsible for providing food to every chiefdom in Sierra Leon. It should be noted that this geographical division of the country only relates to food supply and not distribution. A map illustrating area of responsibility by food supplier is available on request.  16. From 8-11 January, WFP/CRS undertook a joint mission to sensitise the Regional Food Aid Technical Committees and other interested parties to the 1997 food aid strategy. It must be emphasized that the sensitisation process is ongoing and is being executed by the Government of Sierra Leone, UN Agencies, NGOs and donors.  17. The household surveys to determine the vulnerability status of internally displaced families in Bo, Kenema, Makeni and the Freetown camps have now been completed. See point 3, Sitrep dated 6-18 November, 1996 for a more detailed explanation of the purpose of this exercise. The Committee on Food Aid has decided that households which fall within the top ten percent of the vulnerable score should be entitled to the proposed safety net ration. Thus, approximately 2,500 people living in the camps in Freetown will be eligible for food aid in accordance with this vulnerability tool. In Bo and Kenema, the majority of the families surveyed have since returned to their areas of origin and will, therefore, be entitled to the three-month resettlement ration. After this three-month period, only vulnerable households will receive the safety net ration in rural areas. Mechanisms are being developed by the Food Aid Technical Committee to identify vulnerable households who are not registered on existing caseloads. Displaced families living in bush camps fall into this category.  18. It must be stressed that the Committee on Food Aid remains flexible in its approach, particularly with regard to those people who originate from parts of Sierra Leone which are still insecure. For example, returnees to Masimera chiefdom in Port Loko district who were unable to go back to their villages of origin received a one-off emergency distribution in Lunsar. Similarly, displaced originating from the four remaining insecure chiefdoms in Kailahun district will be subject to different vulnerability criteria.  AGRICULTURE 19. During the last part of January 1997, an FAO mission has been implementing the procedures for the procurement of USD 500,000 worth of seed rice for FAOs programmes in Sierra Leone and Liberia. This is a rigorous process as extensive tests need to be undertaken to establish the germination rates and purity of local seed varieties. Procurement of fertilizer and pesticides is also being carried out. It is anticipated that the seed rice will be made available to the Government of Sierra Leone and NGOs in mid-February.  HEALTH 20. MSF-H, in conjunction with the Ministry of Health and Sanitation and other humanitarian partners, has continued to conduct exploratory missions to assess health conditions in different parts of Sierra Leone. During the past six weeks, MSF-H has assessed conditions in Kono district, Daru and Segbwema in Kailahun district and Tungie in the northern part of Kenema district. Of these three locations, Tungie has been inaccessible to the relief community for several years due to security constraints. The single most important conclusion from these assessments, which applies equally to each of these areas, is the low rate of vaccination coverage primarily due to problems of accessibility. Tungie was considered to be a particular problem as an outbreak of measles was confirmed. MSF-H believes that immunisation should be free and that the target population should be six months to 12 years. Nutritional status was deemed to be acceptable in these areas.  21. It is encouraging to note that MSF-Hs concerns are being addressed. On 9 January, 1997 an EPI coordination meeting was held which resulted in the whole of Sierra Leone being mapped for EPI purposes and agreement on areas of intervention being reached by UNICEF, WHO and medical NGOs. Moreover, the MCH director of the Ministry of Health and Sanitation made a statement acknowledging that all EPI activities should be free during 1997. In Tungie, UNICEF supplied the vaccines for a mass Ministry of Health measles immunisation campaign for children between six months and 12 years of age (combined with EPI for under-fives) during the week beginning 13 January 1997.  CHILDREN IN ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES 22. UNICEF received USD 869,000 from the Swedish Government through the UN Inter-agency Consolidated Appeal for emergency operations in the CEDC and education sectors. The funds will be used to provide support for unaccompanied children and teaching and learning materials for continuing education for children in resettled communities.  23. The Inter-Agency Strategy Workshop on CEDC, with special focus on Unaccompanied Children (UAC), organised by the Child Welfare Secretariat of the Ministry of Labour, Social Welfare and Sports and the Ministry of Gender and Childrens Affairs in collaboration with UNICEF and UN-HACU, was held on 8 January 1997. See points 8 and 9, Sitrep dated 19 November-16 December, 1996 for more details. The workshop resulted in the production of draft national policy guidelines on CEDC/UAC and recommendations on elements for inclusion in the policy document. A meeting will be held at UN-HACU on 5 February where these elements will (hopefully) be endorsed.  REFUGEES 24. UNHCR has prepared a repatriation plan for the estimated 361,000 Sierra Leonean refugees who fled the country during the course of the war (232,000 to Guinea; 123,000 to Liberia; and, 6,000 to Gambia/elsewhere). Of those, it is estimated that 173,000 will repatriate with UNHCR assistance, of whom 67,942 will have access to transport. A UNHCR mission from HQ is currently in-country to review repatriation requirements.  25. UNHCR is currently facilitating the voluntary repatriation of 1,400 Sierra Leonean refugees from Monrovia. The Government of Sierra Leone has indicated that it will provide two naval boats to ferry the refugees into Sierra Leone, although the most vulnerable will be transported by air. On arrival in Sierra Leone, approximately 1,000 refugees will be taken by Concern Worldwide to their areas of origin in Bo, Kenema and Pujehun districts and the remainder will stay in Freetown.  NEW ARRIVALS 26. In a follow-up to previous assessment missions, OXFAM- UK and Ireland have recently deployed a Programme Adviser to Sierra Leone for at least six months whose purpose will be to develop a long-term coastal West African Programme strategy with a particular focus on local NGOs. OXFAM can be contacted through Action Aid, Sierra Leone.  27. The Norwegian Refugee Council is currently investigating the possibility of establishing an office in Sierra Leone.

On arrival in Sierra Leone, approximately 1,000 refugees will be taken by Concern Worldwide to their areas of origin in Bo, Kenema and Pujehun districts and the remainder will stay in Freetown.  NEW ARRIVALS 26. In a follow-up to previous assessment missions, OXFAM- UK and Ireland have recently deployed a Programme Adviser to Sierra Leone for at least six months whose purpose will be to develop a long-term coastal West African Programme strategy with a particular focus on local NGOs. OXFAM can be contacted through Action Aid, Sierra Leone.  27. The Norwegian Refugee Council is currently investigating the possibility of establishing an office in Sierra Leone.

120,29167,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Somali refugees Situation Report No. 4,"Emergency Appeal no. 01.04/96 situation report no. 4 period covered: October - December 1996 Some 20,000 refugees from the conflict and famine in neighbouring Somalia are still resident in three camps near Mombasa on the Kenyan coast. The Federation and Kenyan Red Cross Society (KRCS) have been supporting the Somali Refugees , providing camp management, distribution of food and non-food items, preventive and curative health care and social services for five years. It had been expected that this operation would end in October 1996 when the deadline for voluntary repatriation passed. However, another deadline has since passed and in late November, the suspension of the closure of the three camps was announced by the Kenyan Government. The situation in all three camps is tense, and two fires in Swaleh Nguru camp, the second of which saw large-scale intervention (food, shelter materials) from the Federation and KRCS, have not made life any easier for the refugees.  The context The KRCS/Federation supported operation for Somali refugees has been running since February 1992, soon after the refugees' initial arrival in Kenya from civil war and famine in Somalia. Support services include camp management, distribution of food and non-food items, preventive and curative health care and the provision of social services (education, mental health, physiotherapy, and vocational training). The Federation/KRCS currently shares responsibility for three camps holding just under 20,000 refugees.  The intended closure of the camps by the end of 1996 was not realised due to the non-co-operation of the refugees. The original October 15 deadline for ""voluntary registration"" to north-eastern Kenya passed without any registrations. The second extended deadline expired November 15. Following a UNHCR meeting with elders, the immediate closure of the coastal camps was announced. On November 22, the Government of Kenya announced the suspension of the closure of these camps.  Latest events The following resettlements (all to the USA) took place during the period under review: October - 130 individuals;  November - 108 individuals (75 adults, 25 children, 8 infants);  December - families of 17 individuals from Swaleh Nguru camp.  In October, peace talks between the warring factions in Somalia, mediated by President Moi of Kenya, produced a peace agreement between the three leaders -Hussein Aideed, Ali Mahdi Mohammed and Osman Atto. However, the situation in the camps deteriorated, with a number of security incidents occurring in Hatimi, Swaleh Nguru and Jomvu camps.  The Hatimi refugee camp has reported an influx of refugees due to the current interviews for resettlement to the United States, by the Joint Voluntary Agency. This has also led to the mushrooming of new structures built by the registered refugees who were initially staying in the town.  On December 28 a fire broke out in Swaleh Nguru. Fourteen structures, mainly business stalls, were totally destroyed. A further fire in January led to the Federation and Kenyan Red Cross distributing high-protein biscuits, maize and shelter material to 14,000 refugees. A steady increase in malaria cases has resulted from the short rains experienced from November to early December.  In an effort to reduce the running cost of the Project, plans are underway to construct an incinerator in Swaleh Nguru by the end of January 1997. Once completed, the incinerator will drastically cut down the cost of garbage collection.

The beneficiaries of these programmes, who come predominantly from the unregistered population, receive a ration of sugar vegetable oil and blended foods (at 170 grams per person per day). The supplementary feeding programme was suspended in the second half of December as food was found to be mouldy and containing weevils. The programme will resume once stocks are replenished by WFP.

In November, 6,829 pairs of shoes were distributed to Swaleh Nguru camp and 48 blankets were distributed to the vulnerable caseload.  Health Data analysis from Jomvu clinic indicates that jiggers have become a major health problem, and as a response to this the department conducted a Jiggers campaign on December 11. Information regarding the disease was disseminated through the refugee Elders and Health workers. A total of 2,268 refugees were surveyed and 543 (24%) were disinfected. A worm infestation survey was conducted in Hatimi camp. Out of the 122 specimens received 56% contained worms. A de-worming campaign will be conducted once the full results of the survey are received.  In October, an immunisation coverage survey and immunisation campaign was held in all camps. 1,846 children under the age of five were surveyed and 1,084 vaccines were administered. In all, 84% of children under the age of one and 85% of children between the ages of one and five were fully immunised.

The number of admissions has increased dramatically in the last month in the Jomvu Clinic and Utange Clinic, where the bed occupancy is now 100%. This is due to the seasonal increase in malaria cases. The overall increase in the number of cases can be attributed to the stress factors due to fear among the refugees of the camps' closure.  Water, Sanitation and Construction In the last half of the month under review, commercial water trucking was suspended and the Red Cross water tanker started operating seven days a week. Generally the water situation in the camps remains adequate and stable despite the isolated water interruptions associated with the power fluctuations being experienced in the Coastal Region. A meeting was held with the sanitation workers to lay strategies for improving the sanitary conditions in all three camps. The Red Cross is also reviewing its approach towards promoting community involvement in relation to such a project.

On December 5 and 6, the American Red Cross gave the KRCS 10,000 pairs of sandals to the KRCS, the Kilifi and Kwale Branches; each branch received 5,000 pairs of sandals. The ceremony was presided over by the Secretary General of KRCS. Personnel Training and Developmen t A number of workshops, in which National Staff participated, were held during the period under review: the Media Training Course sponsored by ICRC which appeal no. 01.04/96 situation report no. 4 4 focused on providing the skills needed for dealing with the media; the Community Development Training Course on Micro-enterprise skills for Community Development workers and the Disaster Action Team Workshop Staff Composition - October to December    CATEGORY  OCTOBER  NOVEMBER  DECEMBER   Federation Delegates  4  4  3   National Staff  1  1  1   National Society Staff  132  129  129   GoK Seconded Staff  12  14  14   Refugee Volunteers  248  252  252   Total  397  400  399  External relations - Government/UN/NGOs/Media Regional Co-ordinator from the German-based Centre for Disease Control and Prevention regarding the medical processes for the refugees in the Hatimi camp who are scheduled for resettlement; Training Co-ordinator for the International Organisation for Migration to discuss and set up arrangements for training and cultural classes for the resettlement caseload. In December the Secretariat's Desk Officer and Mr. Ephraim. M. Gathaiya, KRCS, Secretary General visited Kenya delegation.  KRCS made a nutritional survey in North East Kenya, in Garissa, which started on 28 December. The exercise started on 28 December and is a follow up of the 2nd mission carried out from 9 to 21 of December 1996 of the Drought Assessment in North Eastern Province, the Emergency Appeal is forthcoming.  Conclusion The unregistered population in all the camps still do not receive food assistance from the Programme as they are not recognised by the UNHCR. It is imperative that UNHCR reviews their status stance and forms a plan to either relocate them or to formalise their stay in the camps. Following the fighting and fire in the Swaleh Nguru camp on 23 January 1997, where the camp was burned to the ground, one refugee killed and 23 wounded, the Government of Kenya's reaction was to announce on Monday 27 January that ""all camps on the coast should be closed with immediate effect"". Negotiations are being undertaken by UNHCR, the Government of Kenya, the Kenya Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to come up with a reasonable time frame for this action. In the meantime a large majority of the 8,000 refugees have started rebuilding their shelters.

122,29719,[12033],Mine Action,BURUNDI-POLITICS: Landmine Explosions Shake Bujumbura,"By Antoine Kaburahe  BUJUMBURA, Mar 25 (IPS) - Three people died and about 10 others were injured on Tuesday when two anti-tank mines exploded in the Burundian capital, just two weeks after similar explosions claimed seven lives here.  One of the blasts occurred when a bus drove over a mine in a street in the northern part of the city centre, while in the other incident, a truck was blown up along the road to Bujumbura's airport.  No group has claimed responsibility for Tuesday's explosions or the previous one, for which an army spokesman had blamed the ''Tutsi extremists of PARENA (Party for National Upliftment), many of whose members were arrested.  PARENA, led by former president Jean Baptiste Bagaza, has a running feud with the government of President Pierre Buyoya, who ousted Bagaza in 1987. However, it had denied any involvement in Mar. 12 attack -- the first mine incident in Bujumbura -- and had called for an investigation into it.  Tuesday's blasts left Bujumbura residents in a state of shock. ''The people who have done this are mad,'' said one blue-collar worker as he stared at the crater left by the city-centre mine. ''They told us that those who committed the first attack had been arrested, so who has done it this time?''  An army spokesman claimed Tuesday on national radio that those responsible were ''the same people as the last time''. He did not elaborate, but his statement seemed to target PARENA once again.  The explosions have raised doubts about the ability of the Buyoya regime to guarantee security in the capital. They have also added a new dimension to the political crisis in Burundi.  For some time now, the army has been battling Hutu rebels in the interior of the country. Now the laying of anti-tank mines in the streets of Bujumbura has brought the violence to the capital of this troubled nation which, just three years ago, had appeared to be on the road to peace.  In mid-1993, after periodic bouts of violence and a string of de facto regimes, Burundi had surprised the world by embarking on a transition to democracy. Beaten in the country's first democratic elections, Buyoya accepted defeat and ceded power to Melchior Ndadaye, the first head of state to come from Burundi's Hutu majority, who make up about 85 percent of the some six million Burundians.  However, Ndadaye was assassinated just three months after he was sworn in and this led to ethnic violence between Hutus and minority Tutsis, in which tens of thousands of people died.  A coalition government formed in late 1994 linked then president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya's mainly Hutu Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) with predominantly Tutsi opposition parties led by the Union for National Progress (UPRONA).  However, it was opposed by Hutu radicals led by a former companion of Ndadaye, Leonard Nyangoma, who argued that FRODEBU had no need to sell out its election victory and share power with its opponents. They went on to form the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), a rebel movement.  The coalition, which was also plagued by internal wrangling, failed to bring peace to Burundi. From its bases in eastern Zaire, the CNDD's armed wing, the Forces for the Defence of Democracy (FDD) carried out ambushes along interior roads, sabotaged electricity installations and partially paralysed the economy.  As the attacks intensified, the Tutsi opposition accused Ntibantunganya of colluding with the rebels and after more than 300 Tutsis were massacred in June 1996 in the central district of Gitega, UPRONA withdrew from the coalition.  Buyoya then seized power on Jul. 25, claiming that his move ''was not a classic coup d'etat but an action meant to save an  entire people''.  His government started to gain the upper hand in the fight against the rebels after the FDD's rear bases in eastern Zaire were dismantled in October-November last by the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation (AFDL) of Congo-Zaire, the insurgent group that has since taken over about a third of Zaire.  Now, however, the urban attacks have placed Buyoya's government in a vulnerable position, adding to the problems it faces as a result of the trade and transport embargo Eastern and Central African nations slapped on Burundi on Jul. 31 in reaction to the coup.

123,29812,[4600],Protection and Human Rights,Report of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation (E/CN.4/1997/10),"E/CN.4/1997/10  Economic and Social Council 20 March 1997   COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS  Fifty-third session  Item 3of the provisional agenda  ORGANIZATION OF THE WORK OF THE SESSION  Introduction  1. At the fifty-second session of the Commission on Human Rights, the Chairman read out a statement indicating the Commission's consensus agreement in connection with the situation of human rights in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation (see E/1996/23-E/CN.4/1996/77, para. 371) and recalled its Chairman's statement of 1995 on the same subject (see E/1995/23-E/CN.4/1995/176, para. 594). In the statement at its fifty-second session, the Commission expressed its deep concern that the disproportionate use of force by the Russian Federation armed forces was continuing to lead to grave violations of human rights, as well as of international humanitarian law.  2. The Commission strongly deplored the high number of victims and the suffering inflicted on the civilian population and on displaced persons, and the serious destruction of installations and infrastructure used by civilians. It called for all those who had committed violations of human rights and other crimes to be brought to justice. The Commission called urgently for an immediate cessation of the hostilities and of violations of human rights and for immediate contacts between representatives of the parties with the aim of achieving a peaceful solution to the conflict, consistent with respect for the territorial integrity and the Constitution of the Russian Federation, and reiterated that the fundamental human rights of the people of the Republic of Chechnya should be upheld. It further called for the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to all groups of the civilian population in need.  3. The Commission requested the Secretary-General to report on the situation of human rights in the Republic of Chechnya at its fifty-third session under the appropriate agenda item. The present report has been prepared in compliance with that request on the basis of information: (a) submitted by the Government of the Russian Federation; (b) available under United Nations human rights mechanisms and procedures; and (c) received from United Nations bodies and programmes, and from intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations.  4. It should be recalled that the hostilities in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation broke out in December 1994. This led to a rapid outflow of displaced persons - the vast majority women and children - from Chechnya to neighbouring republics and territories, as well as to other parts of Russia. The Government of the Russian Federation requested United Nations humanitarian assistance for internally displaced persons located in the three republics where there was the greatest concentration of such persons, namely Ingushetia, North Ossetia and Daghestan.  5. In mid-1995, negotiations conducted under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) began between the Russian Federation and a Chechen delegation, with the goal of reaching both a military and a political agreement. On 30 July 1995, a military agreement was signed but, in the absence of a political agreement, the ceasefire which was envisaged did not take hold. Nevertheless, a significant number of internally displaced persons gradually returned to their homes.  6. On 22 August 1996, a ceasefire agreement was signed. It was followed on 31 August by the signing by federal and separatist negotiators of a statement of principles, which became known as the Khasavyurt Agreement. In accordance with this document, federal forces would be withdrawn from Chechnya and further discussions on how Chechnya was to be administered would be held, while a decision on Chechnya's political status was to be delayed for five years until 31 December 2001. By the end of November 1996, most federal troops had been withdrawn from Chechnya and a joint federal-Chechen commission had been set up. Presidential and legislative elections were held for the Republic of Chechnya on 27 January 1997. Aslan Maskhadov, Prime Minister of the Chechen provisional Government and former chief of staff of Chechen insurgent forces, won the presidential election with 68.9 per cent of the vote. In the legislative elections only a few candidates received more than the required 50 per cent of the vote in their district. A second round of legislative elections was held on 15 February for the remaining electoral districts. Owing to an insufficient turn-out of voters in the second round, a third round of parliamentary elections will be held two months after the second round. On the basis of monitoring by some 100 foreign observers of the first round of the elections, OSCE declared them to have been free and fair, with only minor procedural problems. [back to the contents] I. UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS  7. Since 1995, the High Commissioner for Human Rights has carried out a number of consultations with the Russian authorities on the human rights situation in Chechnya and has maintained contacts with United Nations agencies, intergovernmental organizations, in particular OSCE, and non-governmental organizations concerned with a view to contributing to the promotion and protection of human rights in Chechnya.  8. In February 1997, the High Commissioner and the Government of the Russian Federation agreed on a third visit of the High Commissioner's envoy to the Russian Federation to have consultations in Moscow with the Secretary of the Russian Security Council and in the region concerned. The High Commissioner's envoy previously visited the Russian Federation at the invitation of the Government from 20 to 30 May 1995 and from 28 to 30 March 1996. [back to the contents] II. THEMATIC MECHANISMS OF THE COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS  9. The reports of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to the Commission at its present session contains information on his activities with regard to Chechnya (E/CN.4/1997/60/Add.1, paras. 402-419).  10. The reports of the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture to the Commission at its present session contain information on his activities with regard to Chechnya (E/CN.4/1997/7, paras. 170-171 and E/CN.4/1997/7/Add.1, paras. 417-426). [back to the contents] III. SUB-COMMISSION ON PREVENTION OF DISCRIMINATION AND PROTECTION OF MINORITIES  11. On 21 August 1996, the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities adopted a decision on the humanitarian situation in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation (E/CN.4/1997/2-E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/41, decision 1996/107). [back to the contents] IV. HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY BODIES  12. During the period under review, the only human rights treaty body to consider a report of the Russian Federation was the Committee against Torture. It considered that report (CAT/C/17/Add.15) at its 264th, 265th and 268th meetings held on 12 and 14 November 1996 (see CAT/C/SR.264, 265 and 268).  13. In its concluding observations (see CAT/C/SR.268), the Committee expressed concern regarding widespread reported abuses of human rights in the conflict in Chechnya, including serious acts of torture, coupled with apparent failure to check them and address them speedily and effectively. The Committee recommended the establishment of an independent committee to investigate allegations of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment committed by the military forces of the Russian Federation and Chechen separatists with a view to bringing to justice those against whom there was evidence tending to establish their involvement or complicity in such acts. [back to the contents] V. OTHER ORGANIZATIONS 14. On 27 December 1994, the Government of the Russian Federation, through its Federal Migration Service, requested humanitarian assistance from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for persons displaced from Chechnya. The displaced persons are located principally in the three neighbouring Republics of Daghestan, Ingushetia and North Ossetia, as well as in Chechnya itself. The Government also requested assistance from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which were already present in the region and which were focusing attention initially on displaced persons within Chechnya. [back to the contents]  A. Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  15. On 15 December 1996, in response to a request from the Secretary-General, OSCE provided the following information in connection with their activities in Chechnya, reproduced in extenso below.  ""Human rights in Chechnya following the cessation of hostilities in August 1996  ""1. The Human rights situation in Chechnya changed after August 1996 becoming substantially different from that under conditions of war since the end of 1994. The armed conflict, which severely affected the population of the Republic - Chechen- and Russian-speaking alike - has ceased. The peace process and the resulting political arrangements have steadily solidified since the August cease-fire and subsequent withdrawal of federal troops. On 23 November, President Yeltsin issued a decree ordering the withdrawal of the final federal units from Chechnya. There are grounds to hope for a democratic process in view of the presidential and parliamentary elections to be held on 27 January 1997. With the de facto absence of federal authority, after August 1996, the principal practical responsibility for the protection of human rights is in the hands of the Government of the Chechen Republic.  ""2. In the new environment, it appeared that the human rights situation stabilized relatively, and in some respects improved over the conditions before or after December 1994 (beginning of the war):  Since the end of August 1996, there has gradually been an abolition of checkpoints (block posts), and there is freedom of movement in the Republic, in stark contrast to what existed before.  With the major exception of continuing detention of Chechens arbitrarily taken during the war, human rights violations by the Russian Federation presumably ceased. (There are limited unconfirmed reports of ""provocations"" including attacks on civilians, by persons allegedly linked to the federal security services. These have allegedly resulted in disappearances and killings.)  Although crime affects specifically the Russian speaking population, the Assistance Group (AG) is unaware of any official policy of the Chechen authorities or measures of discrimination against minorities.  No reports have been received that torture was being used systematically against political opponents or other people arrested by the official services, nor about people persecuted for their views.  ""3. The main current human rights problems are - at least in part - a consequence of the war:  In the initial days after the August fighting, there were a variety of unconfirmed reports of isolated revenge killings, or that former Zavgaev regime officials or personnel had been arrested and some allegedly executed. There were continuing additional reports of arbitrary detentions, including by the Chechen Security Service.  In part due to the numerous unemployed former fighters and the weakness of the law enforcement/judicial structures, Chechnya is experiencing an extremely serious crime wave, especially occupation of dwellings and kidnappings. Many people simply have disappeared. In general, kidnapping, like other crimes, has reached crisis proportions. Most of the kidnappings have apparently been for ransom, but the taking of persons for political purposes cannot be excluded. This particularly affects the non-Chechen population, not protected by traditional family or clan ties.  There are still wartime detainees on both sides, and a much larger number of missing persons. The ceasefire and initial peace process agreements called for the exchange of prisoners all against all, a principle rhetorically accepted by both sides. In fact, many prisoners held by the Chechens have been released in the past month, but there have not been commensurate releases on the federal side.  The presence in the Republic of a large, but undetermined quantity of mines and other unexploded ordnance. The vast preponderance of these devices were deployed by federal forces."" [back to the contents] B. International Committee of the Red Cross  16. Since the beginning of the conflict, ICRC, alone and in cooperation with the local committees of the Russian Red Cross Society, operated both inside and outside of Chechnya. Its activities of protection of and assistance to the civilian population included: visiting detainees; search missions to reunite families split up by the fighting; medical assistance; supply of drinking water to prevent outbreaks of epidemics; promotion of respect for humanitarian rules and cooperation; and support of local Red Cross agencies.  17. Tragically, on 17 December 1996 at 4 a.m. local time, six ICRC expatriate delegates were shot dead by unidentified gunmen at their quarters at the ICRC hospital in Novye Atagi, near Grozny. Five of the murdered delegates had been seconded to ICRC by the national Red Cross societies of Canada, the Netherlands, Norway and New Zealand. The sixth, a Spanish nurse, was under contract to ICRC. Another delegate, a Swiss national, had gunshot wounds.  18. Pending an improvement in security conditions and information on the motives for the attack, and also to give itself time to plan its future approach in the region, ICRC has suspended part of its operation, though a number of activities are continuing.  19. Prior to the attack, ICRC had resumed visits to some 30 detainees; transmitted more than 18,000 messages to enable separated families to stay in touch; provided assistance to over 20 health centres treating the war wounded; refurbished and re-equipped two key hospitals in Grozny; was the sole provider of drinking water for the city; carried out sanitation work for villages and schools and for 30 collective centres for displaced persons in Daghestan; launched a major waste evacuation operation to get the sewage system in Grozny working again; provided food parcels, wheat flour, blankets and plastic sheeting to more than 50,000 vulnerable people; prepared 7,000 cooked meals a day in 17 public kitchens; provided essential school equipment to 100,000 children in the region, helped to rebuild or repair schools; distributed some 30,000 sets of children's winter clothing; and provided support to five local communities of the Russian Red Cross in the northern Caucasus in carrying out social programmes for vulnerable groups.  20. After 17 December 1997, all programmes requiring the presence of expatriates have been suspended in the region. Several limited programmes continue. These are supported by ICRC and can be carried out by the local Red Cross or the Ministry of Health. They include: sustaining efforts to gain access to detainees still held by the federal authorities in connection with the conflict in places of detention outside of the Republic of Chechnya; continuing re-equipment of hospitals and medical facilities under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health; operating the pumping station for the chief source of safe drinking water for the city of Grozny; support for 17 public kitchens for vulnerable populations; support for local Russian Red Cross communitie ; dissemination on international humanitarian law for the federal armed forces stationed in the region and training of locally recruited staff to resume dissemination activities in the Republic of Chechnya as soon as the situation permits. [back to the contents] VI. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION  21. In response to a request by the Secretary-General, the Government of the Russian Federation transmitted information and its views in connection with the statement of the Chairman of the fifty-second session of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation. The contents are summarized below. The full document is available for consultation in the Secretariat.  22. The Government outlined the measures taken in 1996 to resolve the crisis in the Chechen Republic. These included a number of presidential decrees and the signing of agreements for the peaceful settlement of the fighting in the Chechen Republic. Notably, on 23 November 1997, President Yeltsin signed the ""Decree on measures for ensuring the further peaceful settlement in the Chechen Republic"", and the ""Agreement on principles of cooperation of the sides until the election of the president and parliament of the Chechen Republic"". The Government stated that the measures taken were evidence of its firm position to resolve the situation in the Chechen Republic by peaceful means and in accordance with the Constitution of the Russian Federation.  23. The Government expressed its concern about problems of criminality in the Chechen Republic which were spilling over into the surrounding region. It provided a brief listing of cases of hostages taken for ransom, threats, physical attacks and killings. The victims included local citizens, officials, visiting national and foreign journalists and humanitarian workers in the region, such as the ICRC hospital workers who were murdered.  24. The Government provided data of the Federal Migration Service of the Russian Federation showing that the flow of people from the Chechen Republic had not ceased following the withdrawal of Russian troops. The Government saw this as a result of increased criminal activity.  25. The Government stated that it had made use of every possible opportunity to ensure protection of the rights of citizens participating in the elections for the parliament and president of the Chechen Republic, in accordance with the Constitution of the Russian Federation.  26. In the framework of strengthening the peaceful regulation of the crisis in the Chechen Republic of the Russian Federation, the Government of the Russian Federation stated that it had cooperated with OSCE in the Chechen Republic.  27. In connection with the events in the Chechen Republic, the Government further stated in the information submitted to the Secretary-General that it was continuing to cooperate with the special mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights. The Government of the Russian Federation considered that the measures carried out by the federal powers with the goal of the peaceful settlement of the crisis in the Chechen Republic of the Russian Federation were fully in accordance with the conditions of the Chairman's statement at the fifty-second session of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation.  28. The Secretary-General thanks the Government for its communications and the constructive cooperation it has provided to the various United Nations mechanisms on human rights. [back to the contents] VII. NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS  29. A number of non-governmental organizations transmitted reports (1) on the situation in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation to the Secretary-General. Such organizations based outside the Russian Federation, included Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, Amnesty International, Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO), Committee to Protect Journalists, the Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania, and the International Group of Parliamentarians on the Problem of Chechnya. Information was also received from organizations based in the Russian Federation, these included the Memorial Society Human Rights Centre, the Congress of Political Parties and Movements of Chechnya, and the Human Rights Institute of Russia.  30. Information from non-governmental organizations changed significantly in nature after the ceasefire in late August 1996. Before the ceasefire, the allegations transmitted were similar to the allegations detailed in the Secretary-General's report of 1996 (E/CN.4/1996/13). Subsequent to the ceasefire and the withdrawal of federal troops, submissions from NGOs have focused on accountability for past abuses, the need for demining, and the general need for increased law enforcement and advisory services on legislative initiatives. [back to the contents] Annex  ACTION BY UNITED NATIONS HUMANITARIAN BODIES AND AGENCIES  A. Department of Humanitarian Affairs  1. The Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) of the Secretariat, in close collaboration with other humanitarian organizations, carries out its task of facilitating interagency communication and coordination through its involvement in information-gathering, liaison with all humanitarian partners, as well as with the Government of the Russian Federation, the dissemination of appeals and situation reports and the establishment of various coordination mechanisms. The overall coordination in-country falls under the responsibility of the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Moscow, who is also the UNHCR Representative and DHA Coordinator.  2. The 1996 programme of emergency humanitarian assistance for persons displaced by the conflict in Chechnya consisted of support for the provision of shelter, water and sanitation, food and health services for the internally displaced persons (IDPs) located in Ingushetia, North Ossetia and Daghestan. The appeal for 1996 sought US$ 13.1 million and had elicited a generous donor response of 81 per cent, as of 30 October 1996.  3. The interagency mission, comprised of headquarters representatives from DHA, UNHCR, the World Food Programme, the United Nations Children's Programme, the World Health Organization, and IOM, visited the north Caucasus region from 22 to 28 October 1996. The mission noted that the situation in that region was extremely complex with a mix of IDP and refugee problems and concluded that a broad regional approach to humanitarian needs was required. Further, it noted that the relative stability in Chechnya following the ceasefire which had come into effect in late August 1996 was enabling the United Nations humanitarian programme to extend limited non-food assistance inside Chechnya.  4. Based on the findings of the mission, a two-pronged approach was recommended for 1997:  (i) Encouragement of the return of IDPs from Chechnya, through the provision of returnee packages and small-scale rehabilitation assistance in villages of origin. The assistance would be managed by United Nations offices in Ingushetia and Daghestan, and would not require the establishment of a United Nations office in Chechnya.  (ii) Support for the integration of those IDPs who will not return, located in Ingushetia, Daghestan, North Ossetia, Kabardino-Balkaria and Stavropol.  B. Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  5. Following the signing of ceasefire and peace agreements on Chechnya in late August 1996, UNHCR began providing small-scale rehabilitation assistance to areas in Chechnya bordering Ingushetia and Daghestan. Small-scale rehabilitation work of health clinics and schools, as well as the distribution of domestic items and food parcels from Saudi Arabia, began in September 1996.  6. The UNHCR intervention is designed to facilitate a phased return of some 75,000 IDPs from and within Chechnya to their former places of residence in Chechnya by improving the living conditions in war-affected areas of return through small-scale rehabilitation and restoration of essential social services and infrastructure.  C. World Food Programme  7. In 1996, WFP assisted more than 90,000 displaced persons in Ingushetia, North Ossetia and Daghestan with a comprehensive food basket of wheat flour, rice, edible oil and sugar. The target group of beneficiaries comprised IDPs from Chechnya and the Prigorodny district, as well as refugees from Georgia. In Ingushetia, the WFP food aid programme was interrupted in July owing to reservations by the local government against indiscriminate and unconditional food distributions to those IDPs who did not wish to return home. Approval was granted in late August and food distributions were immediately resumed.  8. WFP plans to assist the integration of Chechen IDPs in Daghestan and Ingushetia. Besides the provision of food aid packages aimed at facilitating integration, the possibility of food-for-work activities in conjunction with UNHCR shelter rehabilitation work will also be examined.  D. World Health Organization  9. Activities in 1996 were implemented by WHO Copenhagen with logistical support from UNHCR field offices in the region. The main activities carried out were support to the vaccination campaign, cholera control in Daghestan and prosthetic assistance to amputees in Ingushetia and North Ossetia.  10.

At the fifty-second session of the Commission on Human Rights, the Chairman read out a statement indicating the Commission's consensus agreement in connection with the situation of human rights in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation (see E/1996/23-E/CN.4/1996/77, para. 371) and recalled its Chairman's statement of 1995 on the same subject (see E/1995/23-E/CN.4/1995/176, para. 594). In the statement at its fifty-second session, the Commission expressed its deep concern that the disproportionate use of force by the Russian Federation armed forces was continuing to lead to grave violations of human rights, as well as of international humanitarian law.  2. The Commission strongly deplored the high number of victims and the suffering inflicted on the civilian population and on displaced persons, and the serious destruction of installations and infrastructure used by civilians. It called for all those who had committed violations of human rights and other crimes to be brought to justice. The Commission called urgently for an immediate cessation of the hostilities and of violations of human rights and for immediate contacts between representatives of the parties with the aim of achieving a peaceful solution to the conflict, consistent with respect for the territorial integrity and the Constitution of the Russian Federation, and reiterated that the fundamental human rights of the people of the Republic of Chechnya should be upheld. It further called for the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to all groups of the civilian population in need.  3. The Commission requested the Secretary-General to report on the situation of human rights in the Republic of Chechnya at its fifty-third session under the appropriate agenda item. The present report has been prepared in compliance with that request on the basis of information: (a) submitted by the Government of the Russian Federation; (b) available under United Nations human rights mechanisms and procedures; and (c) received from United Nations bodies and programmes, and from intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations.  4. It should be recalled that the hostilities in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation broke out in December 1994. This led to a rapid outflow of displaced persons - the vast majority women and children - from Chechnya to neighbouring republics and territories, as well as to other parts of Russia. The Government of the Russian Federation requested United Nations humanitarian assistance for internally displaced persons located in the three republics where there was the greatest concentration of such persons, namely Ingushetia, North Ossetia and Daghestan.  5. In mid-1995, negotiations conducted under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) began between the Russian Federation and a Chechen delegation, with the goal of reaching both a military and a political agreement. On 30 July 1995, a military agreement was signed but, in the absence of a political agreement, the ceasefire which was envisaged did not take hold. Nevertheless, a significant number of internally displaced persons gradually returned to their homes.  6. On 22 August 1996, a ceasefire agreement was signed. It was followed on 31 August by the signing by federal and separatist negotiators of a statement of principles, which became known as the Khasavyurt Agreement. In accordance with this document, federal forces would be withdrawn from Chechnya and further discussions on how Chechnya was to be administered would be held, while a decision on Chechnya's political status was to be delayed for five years until 31 December 2001. By the end of November 1996, most federal troops had been withdrawn from Chechnya and a joint federal-Chechen commission had been set up. Presidential and legislative elections were held for the Republic of Chechnya on 27 January 1997. Aslan Maskhadov, Prime Minister of the Chechen provisional Government and former chief of staff of Chechen insurgent forces, won the presidential election with 68.9 per cent of the vote. In the legislative elections only a few candidates received more than the required 50 per cent of the vote in their district. A second round of legislative elections was held on 15 February for the remaining electoral districts. Owing to an insufficient turn-out of voters in the second round, a third round of parliamentary elections will be held two months after the second round. On the basis of monitoring by some 100 foreign observers of the first round of the elections, OSCE declared them to have been free and fair, with only minor procedural problems. [back to the contents] I. UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS  7. Since 1995, the High Commissioner for Human Rights has carried out a number of consultations with the Russian authorities on the human rights situation in Chechnya and has maintained contacts with United Nations agencies, intergovernmental organizations, in particular OSCE, and non-governmental organizations concerned with a view to contributing to the promotion and protection of human rights in Chechnya.  8. In February 1997, the High Commissioner and the Government of the Russian Federation agreed on a third visit of the High Commissioner's envoy to the Russian Federation to have consultations in Moscow with the Secretary of the Russian Security Council and in the region concerned. The High Commissioner's envoy previously visited the Russian Federation at the invitation of the Government from 20 to 30 May 1995 and from 28 to 30 March 1996. [back to the contents] II. THEMATIC MECHANISMS OF THE COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS  9. The reports of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to the Commission at its present session contains information on his activities with regard to Chechnya (E/CN.4/1997/60/Add.1, paras. 402-419).  10. The reports of the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture to the Commission at its present session contain information on his activities with regard to Chechnya (E/CN.4/1997/7, paras. 170-171 and E/CN.4/1997/7/Add.1, paras. 417-426). [back to the contents] III. SUB-COMMISSION ON PREVENTION OF DISCRIMINATION AND PROTECTION OF MINORITIES  11. On 21 August 1996, the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities adopted a decision on the humanitarian situation in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation (E/CN.4/1997/2-E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/41, decision 1996/107). [back to the contents] IV. HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY BODIES  12. During the period under review, the only human rights treaty body to consider a report of the Russian Federation was the Committee against Torture. It considered that report (CAT/C/17/Add.15) at its 264th, 265th and 268th meetings held on 12 and 14 November 1996 (see CAT/C/SR.264, 265 and 268).  13. In its concluding observations (see CAT/C/SR.268), the Committee expressed concern regarding widespread reported abuses of human rights in the conflict in Chechnya, including serious acts of torture, coupled with apparent failure to check them and address them speedily and effectively. The Committee recommended the establishment of an independent committee to investigate allegations of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment committed by the military forces of the Russian Federation and Chechen separatists with a view to bringing to justice those against whom there was evidence tending to establish their involvement or complicity in such acts. [back to the contents] V. OTHER ORGANIZATIONS 14. On 27 December 1994, the Government of the Russian Federation, through its Federal Migration Service, requested humanitarian assistance from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for persons displaced from Chechnya. The displaced persons are located principally in the three neighbouring Republics of Daghestan, Ingushetia and North Ossetia, as well as in Chechnya itself. The Government also requested assistance from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which were already present in the region and which were focusing attention initially on displaced persons within Chechnya. [back to the contents]  A. Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  15. On 15 December 1996, in response to a request from the Secretary-General, OSCE provided the following information in connection with their activities in Chechnya, reproduced in extenso below.  ""Human rights in Chechnya following the cessation of hostilities in August 1996  ""1. The Human rights situation in Chechnya changed after August 1996 becoming substantially different from that under conditions of war since the end of 1994. The armed conflict, which severely affected the population of the Republic - Chechen- and Russian-speaking alike - has ceased. The peace process and the resulting political arrangements have steadily solidified since the August cease-fire and subsequent withdrawal of federal troops. On 23 November, President Yeltsin issued a decree ordering the withdrawal of the final federal units from Chechnya. There are grounds to hope for a democratic process in view of the presidential and parliamentary elections to be held on 27 January 1997. With the de facto absence of federal authority, after August 1996, the principal practical responsibility for the protection of human rights is in the hands of the Government of the Chechen Republic.  ""2. In the new environment, it appeared that the human rights situation stabilized relatively, and in some respects improved over the conditions before or after December 1994 (beginning of the war):  Since the end of August 1996, there has gradually been an abolition of checkpoints (block posts), and there is freedom of movement in the Republic, in stark contrast to what existed before.  With the major exception of continuing detention of Chechens arbitrarily taken during the war, human rights violations by the Russian Federation presumably ceased. (There are limited unconfirmed reports of ""provocations"" including attacks on civilians, by persons allegedly linked to the federal security services. These have allegedly resulted in disappearances and killings.)  Although crime affects specifically the Russian speaking population, the Assistance Group (AG) is unaware of any official policy of the Chechen authorities or measures of discrimination against minorities.  No reports have been received that torture was being used systematically against political opponents or other people arrested by the official services, nor about people persecuted for their views.  ""3. The main current human rights problems are - at least in part - a consequence of the war:  In the initial days after the August fighting, there were a variety of unconfirmed reports of isolated revenge killings, or that former Zavgaev regime officials or personnel had been arrested and some allegedly executed. There were continuing additional reports of arbitrary detentions, including by the Chechen Security Service.  In part due to the numerous unemployed former fighters and the weakness of the law enforcement/judicial structures, Chechnya is experiencing an extremely serious crime wave, especially occupation of dwellings and kidnappings. Many people simply have disappeared. In general, kidnapping, like other crimes, has reached crisis proportions. Most of the kidnappings have apparently been for ransom, but the taking of persons for political purposes cannot be excluded. This particularly affects the non-Chechen population, not protected by traditional family or clan ties.  There are still wartime detainees on both sides, and a much larger number of missing persons. The ceasefire and initial peace process agreements called for the exchange of prisoners all against all, a principle rhetorically accepted by both sides. In fact, many prisoners held by the Chechens have been released in the past month, but there have not been commensurate releases on the federal side.  The presence in the Republic of a large, but undetermined quantity of mines and other unexploded ordnance. The vast preponderance of these devices were deployed by federal forces."" [back to the contents] B. International Committee of the Red Cross  16. Since the beginning of the conflict, ICRC, alone and in cooperation with the local committees of the Russian Red Cross Society, operated both inside and outside of Chechnya. Its activities of protection of and assistance to the civilian population included: visiting detainees; search missions to reunite families split up by the fighting; medical assistance; supply of drinking water to prevent outbreaks of epidemics; promotion of respect for humanitarian rules and cooperation; and support of local Red Cross agencies.  17. Tragically, on 17 December 1996 at 4 a.m. local time, six ICRC expatriate delegates were shot dead by unidentified gunmen at their quarters at the ICRC hospital in Novye Atagi, near Grozny. Five of the murdered delegates had been seconded to ICRC by the national Red Cross societies of Canada, the Netherlands, Norway and New Zealand. The sixth, a Spanish nurse, was under contract to ICRC. Another delegate, a Swiss national, had gunshot wounds.  18. Pending an improvement in security conditions and information on the motives for the attack, and also to give itself time to plan its future approach in the region, ICRC has suspended part of its operation, though a number of activities are continuing.  19. Prior to the attack, ICRC had resumed visits to some 30 detainees; transmitted more than 18,000 messages to enable separated families to stay in touch; provided assistance to over 20 health centres treating the war wounded; refurbished and re-equipped two key hospitals in Grozny; was the sole provider of drinking water for the city; carried out sanitation work for villages and schools and for 30 collective centres for displaced persons in Daghestan; launched a major waste evacuation operation to get the sewage system in Grozny working again; provided food parcels, wheat flour, blankets and plastic sheeting to more than 50,000 vulnerable people; prepared 7,000 cooked meals a day in 17 public kitchens; provided essential school equipment to 100,000 children in the region, helped to rebuild or repair schools; distributed some 30,000 sets of children's winter clothing; and provided support to five local communities of the Russian Red Cross in the northern Caucasus in carrying out social programmes for vulnerable groups.  20. After 17 December 1997, all programmes requiring the presence of expatriates have been suspended in the region. Several limited programmes continue. These are supported by ICRC and can be carried out by the local Red Cross or the Ministry of Health. They include: sustaining efforts to gain access to detainees still held by the federal authorities in connection with the conflict in places of detention outside of the Republic of Chechnya; continuing re-equipment of hospitals and medical facilities under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health; operating the pumping station for the chief source of safe drinking water for the city of Grozny; support for 17 public kitchens for vulnerable populations; support for local Russian Red Cross communitie ; dissemination on international humanitarian law for the federal armed forces stationed in the region and training of locally recruited staff to resume dissemination activities in the Republic of Chechnya as soon as the situation permits. [back to the contents] VI. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION  21. In response to a request by the Secretary-General, the Government of the Russian Federation transmitted information and its views in connection with the statement of the Chairman of the fifty-second session of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation. The contents are summarized below. The full document is available for consultation in the Secretariat.  22. The Government outlined the measures taken in 1996 to resolve the crisis in the Chechen Republic. These included a number of presidential decrees and the signing of agreements for the peaceful settlement of the fighting in the Chechen Republic. Notably, on 23 November 1997, President Yeltsin signed the ""Decree on measures for ensuring the further peaceful settlement in the Chechen Republic"", and the ""Agreement on principles of cooperation of the sides until the election of the president and parliament of the Chechen Republic"". The Government stated that the measures taken were evidence of its firm position to resolve the situation in the Chechen Republic by peaceful means and in accordance with the Constitution of the Russian Federation.  23. The Government expressed its concern about problems of criminality in the Chechen Republic which were spilling over into the surrounding region. It provided a brief listing of cases of hostages taken for ransom, threats, physical attacks and killings. The victims included local citizens, officials, visiting national and foreign journalists and humanitarian workers in the region, such as the ICRC hospital workers who were murdered.  24. The Government provided data of the Federal Migration Service of the Russian Federation showing that the flow of people from the Chechen Republic had not ceased following the withdrawal of Russian troops. The Government saw this as a result of increased criminal activity.  25. The Government stated that it had made use of every possible opportunity to ensure protection of the rights of citizens participating in the elections for the parliament and president of the Chechen Republic, in accordance with the Constitution of the Russian Federation.  26. In the framework of strengthening the peaceful regulation of the crisis in the Chechen Republic of the Russian Federation, the Government of the Russian Federation stated that it had cooperated with OSCE in the Chechen Republic.  27. In connection with the events in the Chechen Republic, the Government further stated in the information submitted to the Secretary-General that it was continuing to cooperate with the special mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights. The Government of the Russian Federation considered that the measures carried out by the federal powers with the goal of the peaceful settlement of the crisis in the Chechen Republic of the Russian Federation were fully in accordance with the conditions of the Chairman's statement at the fifty-second session of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation.  28. The Secretary-General thanks the Government for its communications and the constructive cooperation it has provided to the various United Nations mechanisms on human rights. [back to the contents] VII. NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS  29. A number of non-governmental organizations transmitted reports (1) on the situation in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation to the Secretary-General. Such organizations based outside the Russian Federation, included Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, Amnesty International, Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO), Committee to Protect Journalists, the Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania, and the International Group of Parliamentarians on the Problem of Chechnya. Information was also received from organizations based in the Russian Federation, these included the Memorial Society Human Rights Centre, the Congress of Political Parties and Movements of Chechnya, and the Human Rights Institute of Russia.  30. Information from non-governmental organizations changed significantly in nature after the ceasefire in late August 1996. Before the ceasefire, the allegations transmitted were similar to the allegations detailed in the Secretary-General's report of 1996 (E/CN.4/1996/13). Subsequent to the ceasefire and the withdrawal of federal troops, submissions from NGOs have focused on accountability for past abuses, the need for demining, and the general need for increased law enforcement and advisory services on legislative initiatives. [back to the contents] Annex  ACTION BY UNITED NATIONS HUMANITARIAN BODIES AND AGENCIES  A. Department of Humanitarian Affairs  1. The Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) of the Secretariat, in close collaboration with other humanitarian organizations, carries out its task of facilitating interagency communication and coordination through its involvement in information-gathering, liaison with all humanitarian partners, as well as with the Government of the Russian Federation, the dissemination of appeals and situation reports and the establishment of various coordination mechanisms. The overall coordination in-country falls under the responsibility of the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Moscow, who is also the UNHCR Representative and DHA Coordinator.  2. The 1996 programme of emergency humanitarian assistance for persons displaced by the conflict in Chechnya consisted of support for the provision of shelter, water and sanitation, food and health services for the internally displaced persons (IDPs) located in Ingushetia, North Ossetia and Daghestan. The appeal for 1996 sought US$ 13.1 million and had elicited a generous donor response of 81 per cent, as of 30 October 1996.  3. The interagency mission, comprised of headquarters representatives from DHA, UNHCR, the World Food Programme, the United Nations Children's Programme, the World Health Organization, and IOM, visited the north Caucasus region from 22 to 28 October 1996. The mission noted that the situation in that region was extremely complex with a mix of IDP and refugee problems and concluded that a broad regional approach to humanitarian needs was required. Further, it noted that the relative stability in Chechnya following the ceasefire which had come into effect in late August 1996 was enabling the United Nations humanitarian programme to extend limited non-food assistance inside Chechnya.  4. Based on the findings of the mission, a two-pronged approach was recommended for 1997:  (i) Encouragement of the return of IDPs from Chechnya, through the provision of returnee packages and small-scale rehabilitation assistance in villages of origin. The assistance would be managed by United Nations offices in Ingushetia and Daghestan, and would not require the establishment of a United Nations office in Chechnya.  (ii) Support for the integration of those IDPs who will not return, located in Ingushetia, Daghestan, North Ossetia, Kabardino-Balkaria and Stavropol.  B. Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  5. Following the signing of ceasefire and peace agreements on Chechnya in late August 1996, UNHCR began providing small-scale rehabilitation assistance to areas in Chechnya bordering Ingushetia and Daghestan. Small-scale rehabilitation work of health clinics and schools, as well as the distribution of domestic items and food parcels from Saudi Arabia, began in September 1996.  6. The UNHCR intervention is designed to facilitate a phased return of some 75,000 IDPs from and within Chechnya to their former places of residence in Chechnya by improving the living conditions in war-affected areas of return through small-scale rehabilitation and restoration of essential social services and infrastructure.  C. World Food Programme  7. In 1996, WFP assisted more than 90,000 displaced persons in Ingushetia, North Ossetia and Daghestan with a comprehensive food basket of wheat flour, rice, edible oil and sugar. The target group of beneficiaries comprised IDPs from Chechnya and the Prigorodny district, as well as refugees from Georgia. In Ingushetia, the WFP food aid programme was interrupted in July owing to reservations by the local government against indiscriminate and unconditional food distributions to those IDPs who did not wish to return home. Approval was granted in late August and food distributions were immediately resumed.  8. WFP plans to assist the integration of Chechen IDPs in Daghestan and Ingushetia. Besides the provision of food aid packages aimed at facilitating integration, the possibility of food-for-work activities in conjunction with UNHCR shelter rehabilitation work will also be examined.  D. World Health Organization  9. Activities in 1996 were implemented by WHO Copenhagen with logistical support from UNHCR field offices in the region. The main activities carried out were support to the vaccination campaign, cholera control in Daghestan and prosthetic assistance to amputees in Ingushetia and North Ossetia.  10. WHO envisages future activities in the northern Caucasus region which are of primary importance, including projects aimed at the control of communicable diseases in the region, in particular vaccine preventable diseases, acute diarrhoeal diseases and tuberculosis, and mental health assistance.

124,29915,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,"Assistance to refugees in Kibondo, Tanzania","Co-ordinating Office Action by Churches Together (ACT) is a worldwide network of Churches and their related agencies  meeting human need through co-ordinated emergency response and common identity. The ACT network is organizationally based in the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) and the World Council  of Churches(WCC) and is a co-ordinating rather than operational office. A P P E A L ASSISTANCE TO REFUGEES IN KIBONDO, TANZANIA AFTZ71 Appeal Target : US$ 212,000 Geneva, April 7, 1997 Dear Friends, Late 1996, thousands of Burundian refugees fled their country once again, due to renewed violence. Tragically, many of them were earlier returnees from Tanzania, with hopes and expectations that the worst was over. Of the approximately 362,000 refugees in Tanzania, 274,000 are from Burundi alone while nearly 88,000 are Zaireans. Though the last few weeks have witnessed a drop from 1,000 to around 600 refugees per day, the influx continues.  The dramatic increase in the number of refugees seeking safety across the borders in Tanzania is particularly evident in Kibondo district of Kigoma region, a sparsely populated remote rural area bordering Burundi. In Kibondo, Tanzania Christian Refugee Service*s (TCRS*) area of operation where the refugee programme had reached a care and maintenance stage, the influx led to a five fold increase from 20'000 to 100,000 refugees, in two months alone. The Appeals issued in late 1996 were primarily for meeting the immediate needs of the refugees, while this request is to cover their continuing needs during 1997. This Appeal represents the ACT Network*s participation in a UNHCR sponsored programme of nearly US$2 million.  Further details of the ACT/LWF/TCRS programme follows.  We thank you in advance for your support.  ACT/LWF/TCRS Component for Refugees in Kibondo Background Information: The ACT/TCRS refugee program in Kigoma Region was established in early 1994 to assist mainly the refugees from Burundi, who fled the political and ethnic turmoil that has afflicted that country for so many years. About 245'000 people fled to Tanzania in the wake of the violence which erupted after the aborted coup of October 21, 1993. Kibondo District received around 125'000 refugees by mid-December 1993. However, by mid-February 1994, almost 90% of those who had sought refuge in Kibondo District returned to quieter areas in rural Burundi. The remaining 10% feared to return as they were mainly from the high risk groups such as intellectuals and secondary school students, and vulnerable groups like the old and infirm and unaccompanied minors. During 1994, refugee movements continued across the borders between Burundi and Tanzania. It is estimated that about 1000 refugees a month arrived in Kibondo, while a similar number returned to the relatively quieter areas in Burundi. In 1995 the number of refugees in the two camps managed by TCRS, stabilized at around 14'000. With the closing of its borders to the refugees in April 1995, the Government of Tanzania effectively halted the flow of refugees into Kibondo District.  The situation in Burundi has continued to remain very tense with more killings being reported almost daily. The two chief perpetrators, the Hutu militia and the Tutsi dominated army, seem more determined than ever to resolve their differences through mindless violence. The tragedy however, is that many civilians, mainly women, children and the elderly, have become victims of the conflict. The near future holds little or no promise of peace. On the contrary, the situation could deteriorate any moment and result in a massive exodus of refugees into neighboring countries such as Tanzania, despite its borders being officially closed. The Tanzania Christian Refugee Service (TCRS) was founded by the Lutheran World Federation (LWF), the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Tanzania (ELCT) and the Christian Council of Tanzania (CCT), and is a locally registered Christian NGO. Discussions are underway to review the present partnership structure and proposals are being considered for establishing even closer relationship with the Churches in Tanzania.  Recent Activities: ACT/LWF/TCRS has been implementing programmes for refugees from Rwanda and Burundi in Tanzania since 1994. Among its major responsibilities has been the management of three refugee camps of which one camp is a contingency site for arrival of new refugees. The other two camps are Kanembwe which has 13'605 Burundi refugees and Mkugwa, a mixed marriage camp with around 700 refugees, from both Rwanda and Burundi.  ACT/LWF/TCRS, in collaboration with UNHCR, has supported and continues to support an agricultural programme which aims at enabling refugees to achieve self-sufficiency in food . The 1997 cropping season is expected to see the refugees achieve a near 80% self -sufficiency in food. ACT/TCRS has also embarked upon a livestock programme to increase the availability of meat in the camps. As a large group of refugees has assumed a more permanent nature of residency in the camps, ACT/LWF/TCRS plans to support a programme to promote and protect their cultural heritage as well as their traditional activities. ACT/LWF/TCRS will continue to be responsible for camp management and agency operational support besides being specifically responsible for water, sanitation, development and maintenance of shelter and other infrastructure such as roads.  Current Emergency: The Burundi refugee activities had reached a care and maintenance stage in Kibondo, when once again in late 1996, large numbers of refugees started streaming across the border from Burundi. This new influx of around 80,000 refugees necessitated a steady increase in ACT/LWF/TCRS* level of activities with new areas of responsibility. ACT/LWF/TCRS, in collaboration with UNHCR assists in camp management of Nduta, Mtendeli, Kanembwa and Mkugwa camps. In Kanembwa and Mkugwa, ACT/LWF/TCRS is also responsible for Education, Sanitation, Social activities, Agriculture, Environment and Water. ACT/LWF/TCRS developed the new Nduta camp and the Mtendeli contingency sites, which are now full.  Stated Needs: ACT/ LWF/TCRS has been requested to manage as well as service/repair all vehicles (around 25 lorries, including 2 water tankers) needed for refugee transport support in the District. Hence, a small service workshop will be constructed and operated for this fleet. Operation and management of heavy equipment for road construction, camp site clearing and development, will also be part of its responsibilities. This equipment will be used for the entire Kigoma region for the benefit of refugees from Burundi as well as Zaire.  As this Appeal mainly deals with management assistance and contribution towards a larger budget from UNHCR, coordination and management involves half of the salaries for 2 expatriates. The other half of the salaries will be provided by UNHCR. Additional local staff will also be recruited. Due to remoteness, provision for staff allowances and travel expenses need to be made.  ACT/LWF/TCRS foresees a long term involvement and therefore wishes to invest in housing for staff. All houses will be built on Church land using locally available materials and skills, and with the Network*s own funds. This will help obviate at a later stage any dispute on ownership with UNHCR, and the developed property including the service workshop which can be used as a training facility, can be handed over to the Church. The ACT/LWF/TCRS drilling rig in the area will be used for drilling and equipping two boreholes at the staff housing sites.  Funding: UNHCR*s contribution of US$ 1,900,000 awaiting signature, has already been negotiated and agreed upon. The balance amount of US$ 212,000 is being requested from the ACT Network through this Appeal. The implementation timetable for the programme is April to December 1997. Coordination: ACT/LWF/TCRS implements all Refugee Emergency Programmes in collaboration and in coordination with the Tanzanian Government and UNHCR. The activities mentioned for ACT/LWF/TCRS in Kibondo are the result of this coordination and negotiation process, with each Agency being allocated a specific area of responsibility. This is also the reason for the Appeal being delayed. Coordination with the Church is taking place at local level, although the Church is not directly involved in the implemention. Overall coordination with the Church is taking place at provisional levels, while awaiting the formalization of the TCRS-ELCT-CCT relationship this year.

A P P E A L ASSISTANCE TO REFUGEES IN KIBONDO, TANZANIA AFTZ71 Appeal Target : US$ 212,000 Geneva, April 7, 1997 Dear Friends, Late 1996, thousands of Burundian refugees fled their country once again, due to renewed violence. Tragically, many of them were earlier returnees from Tanzania, with hopes and expectations that the worst was over. Of the approximately 362,000 refugees in Tanzania, 274,000 are from Burundi alone while nearly 88,000 are Zaireans. Though the last few weeks have witnessed a drop from 1,000 to around 600 refugees per day, the influx continues.  The dramatic increase in the number of refugees seeking safety across the borders in Tanzania is particularly evident in Kibondo district of Kigoma region, a sparsely populated remote rural area bordering Burundi. In Kibondo, Tanzania Christian Refugee Service*s (TCRS*) area of operation where the refugee programme had reached a care and maintenance stage, the influx led to a five fold increase from 20'000 to 100,000 refugees, in two months alone. The Appeals issued in late 1996 were primarily for meeting the immediate needs of the refugees, while this request is to cover their continuing needs during 1997. This Appeal represents the ACT Network*s participation in a UNHCR sponsored programme of nearly US$2 million.  Further details of the ACT/LWF/TCRS programme follows.  We thank you in advance for your support.  ACT/LWF/TCRS Component for Refugees in Kibondo Background Information: The ACT/TCRS refugee program in Kigoma Region was established in early 1994 to assist mainly the refugees from Burundi, who fled the political and ethnic turmoil that has afflicted that country for so many years. About 245'000 people fled to Tanzania in the wake of the violence which erupted after the aborted coup of October 21, 1993. Kibondo District received around 125'000 refugees by mid-December 1993. However, by mid-February 1994, almost 90% of those who had sought refuge in Kibondo District returned to quieter areas in rural Burundi. The remaining 10% feared to return as they were mainly from the high risk groups such as intellectuals and secondary school students, and vulnerable groups like the old and infirm and unaccompanied minors. During 1994, refugee movements continued across the borders between Burundi and Tanzania. It is estimated that about 1000 refugees a month arrived in Kibondo, while a similar number returned to the relatively quieter areas in Burundi. In 1995 the number of refugees in the two camps managed by TCRS, stabilized at around 14'000. With the closing of its borders to the refugees in April 1995, the Government of Tanzania effectively halted the flow of refugees into Kibondo District.  The situation in Burundi has continued to remain very tense with more killings being reported almost daily. The two chief perpetrators, the Hutu militia and the Tutsi dominated army, seem more determined than ever to resolve their differences through mindless violence. The tragedy however, is that many civilians, mainly women, children and the elderly, have become victims of the conflict. The near future holds little or no promise of peace. On the contrary, the situation could deteriorate any moment and result in a massive exodus of refugees into neighboring countries such as Tanzania, despite its borders being officially closed. The Tanzania Christian Refugee Service (TCRS) was founded by the Lutheran World Federation (LWF), the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Tanzania (ELCT) and the Christian Council of Tanzania (CCT), and is a locally registered Christian NGO.

127,30088,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Sierra Leone Bi-Monthly Information Report No.4,"Period covered: 18 March - 14 April 1997 This report has been prepared by the office of the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Sierra Leone  UN APPEALS FOR USD 68.2 MILLION TO MEET HUMANITARIAN NEEDS IN SIERRA LEONE The Consolidated Inter-Agency Humanitarian Appeal for Sierra Leone was launched in New York, Geneva and Freetown. Following the end of five years of hostilities by the 30 November Abidjan Peace Accord, about one third of the 1.6 million persons displaced by the war have returned to places of origin. The Appeal spanning the period between March 1997 to February 1998 is designed to promote the consolidation of peace and assist the affected population to attain self-sufficiency. Thus food aid will be provided to sustain people displaced or impoverished by the war, to facilitate their return to their communities and to support them while they strive to produce their own sustenance. Similarly, direct benefits such as nutritional supplements, vaccines and educational services for displaced children will be combined with measures to build up the local capacity for the delivery of these services.  The Appeal covers programmes of the World Food Programme (WFP), Office of the United Nation High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), United Nations Volunteers (UNV), the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA). The Appeal also contains annexes reflecting the activities and requirements in 1997 of the International Committee of the Red Cross (USD 16.4 million) and of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies (USD 1.9 million).  The humanitarian activities in the Appeal will provide a basic foundation for the National Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Programme (NRRRP) launched by the Government of Sierra Leone at a Round Table Conference in Geneva in September 1996. The Appeal is designed to provide a basic safety-net for the war-affected and returnees, while the NRRRP establishes conditions for their resumption of a productive life.  SECURITY Clashes between the Military and kamajohs in the diamond-rich Tonga Fields area near Gandorhun resulted in 18 fatalities and numerous casualties. As the wounded filled the hospital in Kenema tensions between the two groups mounted, erupting into violence in the streets of town. A midnight to dawn curfew has been imposed since 24 March. Hassan Conteh and Dep. Minister of Defense Chief Norman Hinga flew to Kenema on separate occasions to attempt to quell the hostilities. As of 31 March the situation has calmed however the curfew remains in effect. GoSL Soldiers in Tonga were withdrawn to Kono.  Combined military and Kamajoh offensives against RUF bases in Kangari Hills and the Moyamba area continued to have a negative impact on road security. On 20 March, five civilians were killed in an ambush along the Kono-Matatoka road, when the vehicle they were travelling in was fired upon.  Recruitment and mobilisation of kamajohs has been stepped up in Kenema to support their efforts in Kailahn. Pendembu was reportedly attacked by RUF forces on 6 April resulting in numerous casualties. At the time of this report the town remains under the control of GoSL Soldiers and kamajohs, however there are reports of continued skirmishes and insecurity in the area.  POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS The 15 March Press Release issued in the name of the RUF High Command deposing Corp. Foday Sankoh as the RUF Leader, (see Humanitarian sitrep of 1-17 March) was welcomed by various sources. President Kabbah issued a statement, dated 15 March in which he expressed the GoSLs willingness to give the new leadership the support and cooperation necessary to achieve Peace in Sierra Leone.  From 25 March, the RUF High Command and War Council held a meeting in Nongowa, a village on the Sierra Leone-Guinea border to review the issue of leadership of the RUF. A delegation including two of the RUF appointees to the Committee for the Consolidation of Peace (CCP) and the Sierra Leonean Ambassador to Guinea, among others, traveled to the meeting via Conakry.  After arriving in the Sierra Leone side of the border in Nongowa, some of the delegation were asked to proceed on to Kailahn town where they were subsequently arrested and detained by RUF Field Commander Bockarie. At the time of this report there is no clear indication of terms or conditions for the release of the delegation.  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT At the World Bank Consultative Group meeting in Paris on 21 March, donors made pledges to Sierra Leone for over USD 640 million, including USD 274 million in grants and USD 23 million in debt relief, the remaining USD 342 million being in loans on concessional terms.  DEMOBILISATION While the political stalemate continues, provision of the Peace Agreement including those pertaining to formal disarmament and demobilisation, cannot be implemented. Consequently, no progress has been made towards the establishment of Assembly Zones for demobilisation as described in the text of the Agreement.  In the most significant step towards demobilisation to date, between 10 to 14 April, 41 persons claiming to be either RUF combatants or affiliates came out of the bush in the Magburaka/Kangari Hills area. The 41 are all males between the ages of approx. 15 to 50 years of age. Initial contact was made with tribal leaders in Magburaka, 30 miles southeast of Makeni, on 10 April, where there are now 16 ex-RUF. This group, which had been roughed up by Kamajohs on the way in, has received medical and nutritional assistance and is described as psychologically sound. Despite preliminary screening procedures, it is unclear at the time of this report as to whether the ex-RUF were indeed bonafide combatants. On 13 April, Kamajohs reported they were guarding 4 RUF in Masingbi and another 21 near Mayawpaw, Kangari Hills area. Efforts are underway to consolidate all the former RUF in a reception centre being established at the Islamic College outside Magburaka. The MNRRR/DDR, the Brigade Commander, Regional authorities, HACU, WFP and NGOs; Concern Universal, SLRC, CRS, and Caritas Makeni, have coordinated efforts to ensure the safety and well-being of the ex-RUF. The ex-RUF were well-received by the civilian population in Magburaka.  INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS A GoSL-appointed Panel of Inquiry looking into allegations concerning management and relief distributions at the Clay Factory IDPs camp in Freetown has produced its final report. The Panel has satisfactorily established that the irregularities occurred due to technical oversights and not with the intent to deprive the IDPs of food. Moreover, there is no sign of malnutrition resultant from the above mentioned irregularities. The Panel has also recommended that the GoSL, through MNRRR should facilitate and lead the movement of displaced people, whose places of origin remain insecure, from the multiple camps in Freetown into a single camp.  The displaced camps in the Western Area have received a final food distribution in line with the ongoing MNRRR repatriation programme initiative. District leaders and the respective camp management have collaborated to finalize lists for repatriation. Displaced from areas that are deemed to be unsafe will be housed in the existing Grafton or Waterloo Camps after additional water, sanitation and other service facilities have been added. MNRRR, plans to discuss with the Education Ministry to allow for students sitting for national examinations to stay in these camps until academic term ends. Humanitarian agencies are concerned that the current health status of these camps will deteriorate greatly with the onset of the rainy season.  A further evaluation of the overall situation of the Freetown displaced camps undertaken by MNRRR and HACU recommends closure of three camps Foray Bay, Ross Road and Clay Factory prior to the rainy season. The inhabitants from safe areas are encouraged to return to places of origin. The Freetown camp downsizing is expected to start after mid-April, going on for one month or more.  RESETTLEMENT At present 671,000 individuals have received resettlement rations at places of origin. Simultaneously Food for Work and Food for Agriculture Schemes are being designed or implemented in resettled communities that will benefit approximately 500,000 persons. All upcountry camps have been seriously downsized as part of the resettlement initiative, except those housing persons from the twelve unsafe Chiefdoms.  However, the NGO community is concerned about expanding resettlement schemes due to the political stalemate, the lack of demobilisation and the uncertain security situation. In light of the recent road insecurity that is apparently related to the delays in the demobilisation process the prepositioning of food stocks upcountry is advisable.  EMERGENCY AGRICULTURE FAO in collaboration with implementing partner Childrens Aid Direct provided 213 resettled farmers in Lunsar District with start up seed and tool packages that are now producing a harvest. The partners are targeting another 200 families in the port Loko District with similar packages. A timely contribution to FAO from the Swedish Government will facilitate the distribution of seeds, tools, fertilizer and crop protectants to 17,000 conflict-affected families who have returned to rural areas throughout the country. Most of the inputs are in place and modes of distribution are in the final planning stages.  CEDC Meetings are continuing in the CEDC sector to ensure that the guidelines developed with Ministry of Social Welfare, UNICEF, HACU and child focused NGOs is in line with the Bill of Rights for the Child being drafted by the Ministry of Gender and Childrens Affairs. In addition, a survey is being planned to examine the impact of training for care givers and a general situation analysis of children exposed to violence in Sierra Leones six years of civil war.  FOOD AID Food agencies distributed 671,000 resettlement rations last month as the final consignment of the three month package. Vulnerable group feeding (VGF) continues for displaced who are unable to return to unsafe chiefdoms and to families who qualify following the household assessment. Efforts are underway to implement VGF programmes in rural areas using village committees to help identify priority families. Institutional feeding is growing in all districts. There are over 500,000 people benefiting from food for work schemes and agricultural support programmes. This will expand with the expected increase in agricultural activities in May.  REFUGEES A UNHCR team in Liberia is screening and registering Sierra Leone refugees for a massive repatriation exercised slated to begin at the end of April. Some 5,000 Sierra Leones are expected to return by seas at the rate of 600 individuals per voyage.  UNHCR is holding a workshop in April. The Workshop will draw participants from the governments of Sierra a Voluntary Repatriation Training Workshop in Freetown from 13 to 16 Leone, Guinea, and Liberia together with UNHCR and NGO staff members operating in the three countries. The aim is to train participants in planning and or implementing voluntary repatriation activities in countries of asylum and or return.  HEALTH UNICEF reports that the outbreak of measles is now under control as they have assisted MSF-Holland and the Ministry of Health to provide vaccination coverage in six Chiefdoms in Kambia District. Port Loko District was previously covered and campaigns in Kabala and Koinadugu are ongoing.  MSF-France will undertake preventative vaccinations against measles and other diseases in Kono District, however, campaigns in the Kailahun District remain on standby for security reasons. A memorandum of understanding between UNICEF and ICRC is under formulation in which UNICEF will supply ICRC to cover Pujehun District and part of Kailahun District as well.  According to WHO and the NGO MERLIN, Lassa Fever continues to spread in the worst-ever documented outbreak of the disease (see Humanitarian Sit-rep of 1-17 March). However, the outbreak appears limited to in and around Segbwema, Kailahun District, along with Tongo and Pangamu, Kenema District. Available supplies of Ribavarin which is no longer manufactured in the USA, continue to dwindle. Moreover, a shift to utilizing a Chinese source of the vaccine is complicated by the lack of field tests.

Following the end of five years of hostilities by the 30 November Abidjan Peace Accord, about one third of the 1.6 million persons displaced by the war have returned to places of origin. The Appeal spanning the period between March 1997 to February 1998 is designed to promote the consolidation of peace and assist the affected population to attain self-sufficiency. Thus food aid will be provided to sustain people displaced or impoverished by the war, to facilitate their return to their communities and to support them while they strive to produce their own sustenance. Similarly, direct benefits such as nutritional supplements, vaccines and educational services for displaced children will be combined with measures to build up the local capacity for the delivery of these services.  The Appeal covers programmes of the World Food Programme (WFP), Office of the United Nation High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), United Nations Volunteers (UNV), the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA). The Appeal also contains annexes reflecting the activities and requirements in 1997 of the International Committee of the Red Cross (USD 16.4 million) and of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies (USD 1.9 million).  The humanitarian activities in the Appeal will provide a basic foundation for the National Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Programme (NRRRP) launched by the Government of Sierra Leone at a Round Table Conference in Geneva in September 1996. The Appeal is designed to provide a basic safety-net for the war-affected and returnees, while the NRRRP establishes conditions for their resumption of a productive life.  SECURITY Clashes between the Military and kamajohs in the diamond-rich Tonga Fields area near Gandorhun resulted in 18 fatalities and numerous casualties. As the wounded filled the hospital in Kenema tensions between the two groups mounted, erupting into violence in the streets of town. A midnight to dawn curfew has been imposed since 24 March. Hassan Conteh and Dep. Minister of Defense Chief Norman Hinga flew to Kenema on separate occasions to attempt to quell the hostilities. As of 31 March the situation has calmed however the curfew remains in effect. GoSL Soldiers in Tonga were withdrawn to Kono.  Combined military and Kamajoh offensives against RUF bases in Kangari Hills and the Moyamba area continued to have a negative impact on road security. On 20 March, five civilians were killed in an ambush along the Kono-Matatoka road, when the vehicle they were travelling in was fired upon.  Recruitment and mobilisation of kamajohs has been stepped up in Kenema to support their efforts in Kailahn. Pendembu was reportedly attacked by RUF forces on 6 April resulting in numerous casualties. At the time of this report the town remains under the control of GoSL Soldiers and kamajohs, however there are reports of continued skirmishes and insecurity in the area.  POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS The 15 March Press Release issued in the name of the RUF High Command deposing Corp. Foday Sankoh as the RUF Leader, (see Humanitarian sitrep of 1-17 March) was welcomed by various sources. President Kabbah issued a statement, dated 15 March in which he expressed the GoSLs willingness to give the new leadership the support and cooperation necessary to achieve Peace in Sierra Leone.  From 25 March, the RUF High Command and War Council held a meeting in Nongowa, a village on the Sierra Leone-Guinea border to review the issue of leadership of the RUF. A delegation including two of the RUF appointees to the Committee for the Consolidation of Peace (CCP) and the Sierra Leonean Ambassador to Guinea, among others, traveled to the meeting via Conakry.  After arriving in the Sierra Leone side of the border in Nongowa, some of the delegation were asked to proceed on to Kailahn town where they were subsequently arrested and detained by RUF Field Commander Bockarie. At the time of this report there is no clear indication of terms or conditions for the release of the delegation.  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT At the World Bank Consultative Group meeting in Paris on 21 March, donors made pledges to Sierra Leone for over USD 640 million, including USD 274 million in grants and USD 23 million in debt relief, the remaining USD 342 million being in loans on concessional terms.  DEMOBILISATION While the political stalemate continues, provision of the Peace Agreement including those pertaining to formal disarmament and demobilisation, cannot be implemented. Consequently, no progress has been made towards the establishment of Assembly Zones for demobilisation as described in the text of the Agreement.  In the most significant step towards demobilisation to date, between 10 to 14 April, 41 persons claiming to be either RUF combatants or affiliates came out of the bush in the Magburaka/Kangari Hills area. The 41 are all males between the ages of approx. 15 to 50 years of age. Initial contact was made with tribal leaders in Magburaka, 30 miles southeast of Makeni, on 10 April, where there are now 16 ex-RUF. This group, which had been roughed up by Kamajohs on the way in, has received medical and nutritional assistance and is described as psychologically sound. Despite preliminary screening procedures, it is unclear at the time of this report as to whether the ex-RUF were indeed bonafide combatants. On 13 April, Kamajohs reported they were guarding 4 RUF in Masingbi and another 21 near Mayawpaw, Kangari Hills area. Efforts are underway to consolidate all the former RUF in a reception centre being established at the Islamic College outside Magburaka. The MNRRR/DDR, the Brigade Commander, Regional authorities, HACU, WFP and NGOs; Concern Universal, SLRC, CRS, and Caritas Makeni, have coordinated efforts to ensure the safety and well-being of the ex-RUF. The ex-RUF were well-received by the civilian population in Magburaka.  INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS A GoSL-appointed Panel of Inquiry looking into allegations concerning management and relief distributions at the Clay Factory IDPs camp in Freetown has produced its final report. The Panel has satisfactorily established that the irregularities occurred due to technical oversights and not with the intent to deprive the IDPs of food. Moreover, there is no sign of malnutrition resultant from the above mentioned irregularities. The Panel has also recommended that the GoSL, through MNRRR should facilitate and lead the movement of displaced people, whose places of origin remain insecure, from the multiple camps in Freetown into a single camp.  The displaced camps in the Western Area have received a final food distribution in line with the ongoing MNRRR repatriation programme initiative. District leaders and the respective camp management have collaborated to finalize lists for repatriation. Displaced from areas that are deemed to be unsafe will be housed in the existing Grafton or Waterloo Camps after additional water, sanitation and other service facilities have been added. MNRRR, plans to discuss with the Education Ministry to allow for students sitting for national examinations to stay in these camps until academic term ends. Humanitarian agencies are concerned that the current health status of these camps will deteriorate greatly with the onset of the rainy season.  A further evaluation of the overall situation of the Freetown displaced camps undertaken by MNRRR and HACU recommends closure of three camps Foray Bay, Ross Road and Clay Factory prior to the rainy season. The inhabitants from safe areas are encouraged to return to places of origin. The Freetown camp downsizing is expected to start after mid-April, going on for one month or more.  RESETTLEMENT At present 671,000 individuals have received resettlement rations at places of origin. Simultaneously Food for Work and Food for Agriculture Schemes are being designed or implemented in resettled communities that will benefit approximately 500,000 persons. All upcountry camps have been seriously downsized as part of the resettlement initiative, except those housing persons from the twelve unsafe Chiefdoms.  However, the NGO community is concerned about expanding resettlement schemes due to the political stalemate, the lack of demobilisation and the uncertain security situation. In light of the recent road insecurity that is apparently related to the delays in the demobilisation process the prepositioning of food stocks upcountry is advisable.  EMERGENCY AGRICULTURE FAO in collaboration with implementing partner Childrens Aid Direct provided 213 resettled farmers in Lunsar District with start up seed and tool packages that are now producing a harvest. The partners are targeting another 200 families in the port Loko District with similar packages. A timely contribution to FAO from the Swedish Government will facilitate the distribution of seeds, tools, fertilizer and crop protectants to 17,000 conflict-affected families who have returned to rural areas throughout the country. Most of the inputs are in place and modes of distribution are in the final planning stages.  CEDC Meetings are continuing in the CEDC sector to ensure that the guidelines developed with Ministry of Social Welfare, UNICEF, HACU and child focused NGOs is in line with the Bill of Rights for the Child being drafted by the Ministry of Gender and Childrens Affairs. In addition, a survey is being planned to examine the impact of training for care givers and a general situation analysis of children exposed to violence in Sierra Leones six years of civil war.  FOOD AID Food agencies distributed 671,000 resettlement rations last month as the final consignment of the three month package. Vulnerable group feeding (VGF) continues for displaced who are unable to return to unsafe chiefdoms and to families who qualify following the household assessment. Efforts are underway to implement VGF programmes in rural areas using village committees to help identify priority families. Institutional feeding is growing in all districts. There are over 500,000 people benefiting from food for work schemes and agricultural support programmes. This will expand with the expected increase in agricultural activities in May.  REFUGEES A UNHCR team in Liberia is screening and registering Sierra Leone refugees for a massive repatriation exercised slated to begin at the end of April. Some 5,000 Sierra Leones are expected to return by seas at the rate of 600 individuals per voyage.  UNHCR is holding a workshop in April. The Workshop will draw participants from the governments of Sierra a Voluntary Repatriation Training Workshop in Freetown from 13 to 16 Leone, Guinea, and Liberia together with UNHCR and NGO staff members operating in the three countries. The aim is to train participants in planning and or implementing voluntary repatriation activities in countries of asylum and or return.  HEALTH UNICEF reports that the outbreak of measles is now under control as they have assisted MSF-Holland and the Ministry of Health to provide vaccination coverage in six Chiefdoms in Kambia District. Port Loko District was previously covered and campaigns in Kabala and Koinadugu are ongoing.  MSF-France will undertake preventative vaccinations against measles and other diseases in Kono District, however, campaigns in the Kailahun District remain on standby for security reasons. A memorandum of understanding between UNICEF and ICRC is under formulation in which UNICEF will supply ICRC to cover Pujehun District and part of Kailahun District as well.  According to WHO and the NGO MERLIN, Lassa Fever continues to spread in the worst-ever documented outbreak of the disease (see Humanitarian Sit-rep of 1-17 March). However, the outbreak appears limited to in and around Segbwema, Kailahun District, along with Tongo and Pangamu, Kenema District. Available supplies of Ribavarin which is no longer manufactured in the USA, continue to dwindle. Moreover, a shift to utilizing a Chinese source of the vaccine is complicated by the lack of field tests.

128,30095,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Tanzania: Refugee Situation Report,"UNITED NATIONS Department of Humanitarian Affairs Integrated Regional Information Network for the Great Lakes   Tel: +254 2 622147 Fax: +254 2 622129 E-mail: irin@dha.unon.org   INTRODUCTION  1. Since November 1996 the number of refugees in Kigoma region has escalated from 50,000 Burundian refugees to 267,000 refugees of Burundian and Zairean nationality today. The recent influx brings the total number of refugees in Tanzania to about 368,000, including the refugees already living in Ngara district of Kagera region (1). The sheer scale of the influxes prompted emergency interventions by relief agencies and the temporary creation of transit centres. Today, the agencies are in the process of extending existing sites to accomodate the refugees and developing a new camp at Lugufu.   2. This situation report follows a recent DHA/IRIN field visit to the districts of Kigoma, Kasulu and Kibondo in Kigoma region and Ngara in Kagera region. It describes the circumstances leading to the arrival of this recent wave of refugees, the ways they are assisted on arrival and conditions in refugee camps to which they are being transferred. It also decribes conditions in, and issues relating to, the older refugee camps. The report concludes by assessing the attitude of the Government of Tanzania to the latest waves of arrivals in Kigoma region. A map of the camps in Kigoma region is available from IRIN by fax or e-mail (GIF format) or on DHA ReliefWeb's site.   THE ARRIVAL OF REFUGEES FROM ZAIRE  3. Since November about 90,000 Zaireans have entered Tanzania seeking protection, coming from the Uvira, Baraka and Fizi regions along the shores of Lake Tanganyika. They have been joined by about 9,700 Burundians and 2,200 Rwandans who had been refugees in camps near Uvira. The first arrivals came by boat and arrived near Kigoma town on 2 November, fleeing fighting between rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) and the Zairean Army. Within days, Burundian and Rwandan refugees from Zaire began to arrive. During the month of November as a whole, 29,000 Zaireans arrived in Kigoma region as well as 5,000 Burundian and 1,800 Rwandan refugees from Zaire.   4. The influx from Zaire has continued ever since, with a further 10,000 Zaireans arriving in December, 24,000 in January, 26,000 in February and 8,700 in March. In February, the fall of the town of Kalemie to the ADFL lead to an influx of Zaireans from the Kalemie area to Kigoma; today they respresent about 1% of the total Zairean caseload. The influx of Burundian and Rwandan refugees from Zaire tailed off rapidly, with 3,000 Burundians arriving in December, 950 in January, 500 in February and 140 in March, while 370 Rwandans arrived in December and less than 30 have been registered since then. It should be noted that Burundian arrivals from Zaire are here treated distinctly from Burundian arrivals coming directly into Tanzania from Burundi, who are dealt with in the following section.   5. The reasons given by Zaireans for leaving their country relate directly to the conflict between ADFL rebels and Government troops and the progressive takeover of eastern Zaire by the rebel forces. During November the main reasons the refugees gave for leaving were fighting between ADFL forces and Government troops and insecurity created by fleeing Government soldiers. As the rebels established control over Uvira and extended their territory south down the western shore of Lake Tanganyika, a new set of concerns arose. Zaireans from the area left because they feared being caught up in a Zairean Government counter-offensive or being forcibly enlisted into ADFL ranks.   6. Some of the refugees were simply uncertain of how the conflict would evolve, and decided to come to Tanzania to bide their time until the situation had normalized, while others foresaw the rebel takeover of the whole territory along the Lake. The vast majority of Zairean refugees in Tanzania come from the Bembe ethnic group (2), which have had a tense relationship with the Banyamulenge community in Zaire and sided with Government forces against the ADFL in fighting during November and December 1996 (3). Zaireans continue to arrive in Kigoma, with the number varying from a little as 79 a day (27/3) to 303 (31/3). They cite continuing insecurity in the Fizi area as their reason for leaving. The Burundian and Rwandan refugees who left in November and December feared staying in an area under ADFL control and chose to go to Tanzania rather than returning to their countries of origin.   7. The vast majority of Zaireans arriving in Tanzania either made their own way towards Kigoma town or were picked up from the lakeshore in Tanzania by UNHCR boats. Many paid for their boat fares of $10 and brought possessions with them, indicating their status as former urbanites. Three transit centres were established within Kigoma town to cater for the new arrivals, as initially there was insufficient capacity within existing camps to accomodate them. These centres swelled rapidly in size, and at their peak in early February were home to about 32,000 people. This also slowed down the transfer of refugees from the lakeshore to the centres themselves.   8. Although health screenings, immunizations and interventions to provide water and sanitation, food, accomodation and non-food items were swiftly undertaken by UNICEF, WFP, IRC, Caritas, WorldVision and MSF-Spain, under UNHCR's coordination, a cholera outbreak and wider concerns about public health conditions in the overcrowded sites prompted efforts to accelerate the development of the identified contingency sites. A small minority of the refugees, estimated to be less than 10,000, initially went to stay in lakeshore villages, living among friends or relatives. About 4,800 people of these people living along the lakeshore are reported to have gone back to Uvira on their own initiative.   9. Zairean refugees were first transferred to Nyaragusu, a site in Kasulu district originally chosen to house Burundian refugees. Since February, Zaireans have been transferred to Lugufu, a new camp being developed about 85 kms east of Kigoma town. As of 11 March this site accomodated some 45,000 refugees. Burundian refugees have been directed to the Mtabila and Muyovosi camps in Kasulu district, while the small number of Rwandans, living in one of the transit centres in Kigoma town or in Mkugwa camp in Kibondo district, were subsequently repatriated as part of Tanzanian Government's repatriation of Rwandan refugees in December 1996. Refugees requiring medical treatments unavailable in the transit centres were referred to three hospitals in Kigoma town, while cholera cases were dealt with at the cholera centres in one of the transit camps or Ujiji hospital, supported by UNICEF and MSF-Spain. By the end of March, two of the three transit camps had closed down altogether, while the third site, the stadium, housed only 688 relatives of 229 Zairean soldiers who arrived in February.   THE CAMPS FOR ZAIREAN REFUGEES  10. Nyaragusu: This camp, home to 45,000 Zairean refugees, is located in Kasulu district, 55 kms north of Kasulu town. An estimated 70% of the refugees are from Fizi, while the rest are from the Uvira area. The camp is situated in a flat, wooded area and divided up into villages with refugees inhabiting small houses, built from wood and mud, with plastic sheets for roofing. The refugees receive 13 litres of water per person per day and an estimated 1900 kcal from their food basket. The refugees complain both about the quantity and type of food they are given, as they are used to fish and manioc, and several security incidents in relation to this have taken place, the most recent being a riot on 22 March. The main agencies in the camp are UNHCR, WFP, UNICEF, WorldVision (camp management), AEF (Africa Educational Fund, responsible for health care), OXFAM (water and sanitation), and Christian Outreach (social services).   11. Some 3,000 people in Nyaragusu have registered to return to Zaire, most of them to the Uvira area. When questioned about this, they replied that they had heard that the situation in Uvira is quite stable and they are unhappy about staying on because of the conditions in the camp, particularly in relation to food. A young man from Uvira, who came to Tanzania in late November by walking south and paying $10 for a boat trip to Kigoma, complained about the lack of food and said he wanted to return. An elderly woman from Fizi, who left Zaire in late October with some members of her family, said that some people wanted to return because of the lack of food but that she preferred to stay because there are 'still problems in Zaire'. She said she was afraid of the Banyamulenge.   12. Lugufu: This recently established camp is now home to 45,000 Zairean refugees and is located 85 kms east of Kigoma town. The camp is situated in a swampy area and refugees are currently living directly under plastic sheets propped up by pieces of wood. The camp has been severely affected by the onset of the rains and the ground is permanently wet, with some sites provisionally allocated for villages having had to be abandoned due to being waterlogged. The food ration for the refugees, at an estimated 1200-1600 kcal per day, reflects the difficulties WFP has experienced in transporting food to the camp. This is the result of a shortage of trucks and the extremely poor road conditions in the vicinity, which are often impassable now the rains are underway.   13. The water supply situation in the camp is very poor, with the IFRC currently relying on tankers to bring water from the outskirts of the camp, where it is being pumped from a small river and treated. Due to the poor road conditions, the arrival of the tankers is being interrupted, resulting in water shortages for the refugees, who receive only 6.2 - 6.7 litres per person per day. During the course of the mission, a riot about water took place in the camp, forcing the temporary evacuation of staff. The public health situation is a cause for serious concern, as the camp is overwhelmingly dependent on communal latrines, with only 24 family latrines having been constructed. Combined with the water shortages, the water-logged ground and lack of adequate drainage, the health of the refugees is a growing concern for the agencies working in the camp.   THE ARRIVAL OF REFUGEES FROM BURUNDI   14. During November 1996 63,000 Burundians fled Burundi and arrived in Kigoma region, 50,000 of them in Kibondo district. Since then the number of new arrivals has diminished; with 22,000 in December, 16,000 in January, 9,000 in February and 5,500 in March. There have been two previous influxes of Burundians into Tanzania. The first took place in 1972; the second was in 1994 following the killing of President Ndadaye. The influx of November 1996 was preceded by smaller influxes throughout the earlier part of the year. When, in December 1996, the Tanzania Government repatriated all the Rwandan refugees in Tanzania, the Burundians were allowed to remain, in recognition of the insecurity in Burundi.   15. Many of the arrivals since November come from Ruyigi and Rutana districts in Burundi, which border Tanzania, but interviews in the camps suggest Burundians are arriving from all parts of the country, including Gitega, Karuzi, Bujumbura and even Bururi and Cibitoke. The refugees are exclusively of Hutu ethnicity and are nearly all from rural areas, unlike the Zairean refugees who are mostly from urban or semi-urban places. The vast majority of Burundian and Zairean refugees in all the camps in Kigoma region are women and children.   16. Arrivals of Burundian refugees in Tanzania in the latter half of 1996 relate to the changing climate in Burundi since Major Buyoya's coup in July, but the November influx appears to have been caused by an escalation in the conflict between October and December, with the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Burundi, Paulo Serghio Pinheiro, reporting that during this period both the army and rebel groups took advantage of the conflict in eastern Zaire to launch new offensives. In particular, there is evidence that the break-up of the refugee camps near Uvira led some Burundian rebels to enter the country, causing an escalation in fighting. The Special Rapporteur also reports that large numbers of Burundian rebels, including their general staff, fled the camps in eastern Zaire and relocated to Tanzania (4).   17. On arriving in Tanzania, Burundian refugees are directed from UNHCR's assembly points straight to the refugee camps. Most new arrivals have gone to three camps; Mtendeli in Kibondo district and the recently established camps in Kasulu district, while others have been settled in extensions of older sites. Many of the refugees arriving in Tanzania are in poor health, with children showing signs of malnutrition. This suggests that some of them may have spent considerable periods of time displaced from their homes prior to crossing the border. The following section describes the recently established camps as well as the older camps in Kasulu, Kibondo and Ngara districts, home to Burundian refugees who fled previous escalations in fighting.   THE CAMPS FOR BURUNDIAN REFUGEES  18. The camps in Kasulu and Kibondo districts are all located to either side of the main road linking Kasulu town with Kibondo town and Ngara town. This road lies between 20 and 40 kms away from the border and runs almost its whole length. The road is in very poor condition and large stretches are flooded during the current rainy season. For this reason, major logistical problems affect all of the camps and cause shortages in, for example, the supply of non-food items.   19. The older camps (Mtabila in Kasulu, Kanembwa and Mkugwa in Kibondo) originated in 1994 and are more settled than the camps established in 1996 (Nyaragusu in Kasulu and Mtendeli and and Nduta in Kibondo). All of the camps are home to Burundian refugees, with the exception of Nyaragusu (see above) and Mkugwa, which is a special case (see below). The difference between the age of their camps is reflected in their facilities; refugees in the older camps benefit from access to limited agricultural land and some permanent structures for community based education. In the new camps refugees do not have access to land or formal education, as the Tanzanian Government argues these will encourage refugees to stay for the long-term.   20. The common health complaints in all of the camps are malaria and anaemia. Refugees who require medical treatments that cannot be given in the camps are referred to the district hospitals in Kasulu and Kibondo towns. These are being rehabilitated under Swiss Cooperation in Kibondo, while MSF-Spain provides material support to those hospitals. An issue affecting the areas around all the camps is the environmental damage caused by refugees, particularly the cutting down of trees. UNDP recently organized assessment missions to Kigoma and Kagera regions to investigate the situation and is in the process of establishing a programme to rehabilitate the refugee-affected areas. CARE has already embarked on a project to rehabilitate the sites of former refugee camps in Ngara and will assess, in consultation with UNHCR and camp management NGOs, the type of environmental activities required for Kigoma.   21. The main UN agencies and NGOs working in the camps are UNHCR, WFP, UNICEF, the IFRC and the Tanzanian Red Cross (health services), Oxfam UK and Ireland (water and sanitation), International Rescue Committee (health services), the ICRC (tracing), Tanganyika Christian Refugee Service (various sectors including camp management and agriculture), Christian Outreach (community services), AFRICARE (community services), Disaster Relief Agency (community services) and CARE (environmental protection).   KASULU DISTRICT  22. Moyovosi: This camp was established last year, is home to 40,000 Burundian refugees and is located 42 kms north of Kasulu town. The camp, situated across a stretch of low-lying hills, has the appearance of a village, with refugees living in small mud houses with roofs of plastic sheeting. Water is pumped from a nearby stream and refugees receive 15-20 litres per person per day, while Oxfam are also in the process of establishing a gravity system for the camp. The IFRC and the Tanzanian Red Cross are responsible for supplementary and therapeutic feeding in the camp.   23. Mtabila: The original camp was opened in March 1994 but has recently been extended to accomodate recent arrivals from Burundi. The camp is home to 33,000 refugees of Burundian nationality, and is situated right next to Muyovosi, some 35 kms from Kasulu town. The camp has the appearance of a normal rural settlement. In terms of water, refugees receive 30 litres per person per day in the original site, although it appears that this figure does not apply to the extension where difficulties in establishing water systems are being experienced.   KIBONDO DISTRICT  24. Mtendeli: Mtendeli was first established in July 1996 and until November was home to 11,000 Burundian refugees. Following the November influx into Kibondo District the camp population increased and now stands at 66,000 after refugees were transferred to Nduta in order to try and decongest the camp. The refugees come from the provinces of Ruyigi, Cankuzo, Karuzi and Muyinga. The camp is located 38 kms north-east of Kibondo town and is situated in a wooded area. The main problem in the camp is the shortage of water, currently supplied from streams at 6 litres per person per day, while the Tanganyika Christian Refugee Service (TCRS) continues to drill for water. In terms of food, the refugees receive a ration of 1,551 kcal per person per day. As in other recently established camps, formal education is not allowed by the authorities but the DRA is assisting community based initiatives. Some 1,000 refugees have registered to return to Burundi.   25. Nduta: Established in December 1996, this is the newest camp in the district and is currently receiving all new arrivals from Burundi. It has a population of 17,800 Burundian refugees, who come from Ruyigi, Cankuzo and Gitega provinces. Located 29 kms south-east of Kibondo town, the camp is situated in a flat, wooded area. Water, provided by Oxfam, is pumped from two nearby streams. Most camp structures are temporary and the long-term future of the camp is uncertain as the Government of Tanzania has had second thoughts about the location of the camp, which is only 6 kms away from a National Reserve. It seems likely that the size of the camp will remain small.   26. Mkugwa: This camp was established in March 1994 and caters only for 'special protection cases', mainly Burundians in mixed ethnicity marriages. At present there are 1,012 people living in the camp, of whom 786 are Burundians, 201 Rwandans in mixed ethnicity marriages and 25 Banyamulenge from eastern Zaire. The camp is located 45 kms south of Kibondo town and has the appearance of a normal rural settlement. Water is provided from a borehole, run by TCRS, which supplies 14 litres per person per day. Refugees receive a food basket of 1,839 kcal per person. The IRC run a health clinic in the camp and a supplementary feeding programme, and are responsible for community services, which include a self reliance programme and adult education for literacy, while a primary school is run by TCRS.   27. The Rwandans have formally requested asylum and are currently awaiting a decision from the Tanzanian Government. They are all in mixed marriages and say they are afraid to go back to Rwanda. The Banyamulenge come from Uvira and fled south to Kalemie with the local population before crossing to Kigoma by boat. On arrival in Kigoma they said they were afraid of staying in the same place as the other Zairean refugees. The Banyamulenge say they would like to go to Rwanda (this group is reported to consider themselves Rwandans) and UNHCR has made representations to the Tanzanian Government to explore this possibility with the Rwandan authorities.   28. Kanembwa: This camp was also established in March 1994 and is the most settled of all the Kibondo camps, with refugees enjoying relatively large plots and having access to 6,000 acres for agriculture. Located only 15 kms north of Kibondo town, the camp has the appearance of a rural settlement, with the benefit of permanent buildings including primary and secondary schools. The camp is home to 19,000 Burundians. WFP continues to supply food to the camp, which is supplemented by food cultivated by the refugees.   NGARA DISTRICT  29. Greater Lukole: As of the end of November 1996 some 82,000 Burundians were already living in three camps in Ngara district, Musuhura (2,300), Lukole (20,000) and Kitali (60,000). Following the Tanzanian Government's repatriation of Rwandan refugees, the Government decided that all Burundian refugees should be in one camp. The site chosen was Lukole, and as a first step the refugees from Kitale were transferred. According to the March 1997 verification, the camp population of Greater Lukole is now 101,000. Agencies are still in the process of scaling up to meet the increased demands, particularly in terms of health and sanitation. There is also an old refugee settlement called Burugi in Muleba District which is currently accomodating 249 Burundian refugees who fled to Tanzania before October 1993.   30. Following the mass repatriation of Rwandan refugees in December 1996 the Government of Tanzania launched an anti-illegal immigrant operation throughout the country. In Ngara between January and March the policy resulted in the uprooting and forcible relocation of over 13,000 Burundians into Greater Lukole camp from Tanzanian villages. This caseload was composed of Burundian migrants and refugees who had spontaneously settled in Tanzanian villages contrary to Government directives that all refugees from Burundi had to stay in designated camps. A large number of the uprooted Burundians were inter-married with Tanzanian nationals or children of such unions.   31. There is a high level of tension in Greater Lukole camp due to the presence of activists of opposing Burundian political factions. Prior to the relocation of Burundian refugees to Lukole from Kitale Hills camp in late December and early January, there was an outbreak of inter-refugee politically motivated violence, during which at least 12 refugees were killed and over three hundred were injured. According to police investigations it appeared that the majority of the victims had been refugees accused of being sympathetic to the CNDD. The authorities attributed the violence to supporters of the PALIPEHUTU. In subsequent police action over 200 refugees suspected of involvement in the Kitali Hills violence were arrested and 126 of them were refouled to Burundi where they reportedly were summarily killed by the Burundian military at the Kobero Border Post on 10 January 1997. In light of international criticism and condemnation over the killings, the Government of Tanzania undertook not to forcibly return any refugees to Burundi in future. However, political tension amongst the refugees in Lukole persists.   32. General security in Ngara District and in the camp has deteriorated following the mass repatriation to Rwanda, as some of the Rwandans who avoided the repatriation fled to the forests. Some of these Rwandans are reportedly implicated in the rise in armed robberies and criminal attacks on the local population that is causing some families to be displaced. This increase in crime is also attributed to the sudden and drastic scaling down of refugee programmes and the attendant unemployment and shrinking of economic opportunities.   33. Since January 1997 there has been an increase in the spontaneous repatriation of Burundian refugees. To date at least 9,000 refugees have spontaneously returned to Geteranyi Commune, Muyinga Province. This movement is still continuing and usually takes place at night and through informal border crossing points. The Tanzanian Government, however, directed at the beginning of April that henceforth all movements would be through the official border at Kabanga/Kobero Border Post.   THE ATTITUDE OF THE TANZANIAN GOVERNMENT  34. Despite the fact that Tanzania has for a long time declared its border with Burundi closed for new arrivals, the Tanzanian authorities have continued to allow Burundians fleeing the conflict in their country to seek asylum in Tanzania. The same has been true for the recent influx of refugees from Zaire. There has, however, been a shift on the part of the Government towards not allowing camp conditions at a level that will, they argue, encourage refugees to stay in the long-term. This is why the the Government is unwilling to allow, in the recently created camps, the creation of permanent structures for schools, the hiring of teachers in the camps, income-generating activities or farming.   35. The siting of Lugufu camp in its inappropriate location (see above), may also be an indication that the Government is keen for Zairean refugees not to stay in the medium-term. Senior Government officials also insist that no additional sites for new arrivals be allocated but rather that plot sites in existing camps like Mtabila and Kanembwa be further reduced to cater for newly arrived refugees.   36. Tanzanians from Kigoma and Kagera regions are quick to point out that the massive presence of refugees has placed additional pressures on the area. Roads, for example, have been damaged by the large trucks used to transport both refugees and relief, while the presence of refugees has lead to increased insecurity and enviromental destruction. As relief agencies have come in to assist, there have also been price rises in several sectors. On the other hand, relief agencies have also implemented programmes that benefit local people, such as the rehabilitation of district hospitals and the improvement of roads and other infrastructure. Kigoma is the second poorest region in Tanzania (after Coast region), lagging behind the rest of the country in terms of health, education and infrastructure.   37. The Vice-President in a recent visit to Kasulu district called for Burundian refugees to return home (5), although in his subsequent visit to Kibondo he reassured refugees that they will not be coerced to repatriate as long as the situation in Burundi is not condusive. The Tanzanian Government has made it known that it will establish its own contacts with Laurent Kabila, leader of the ADFL, as de facto controller of those parts of Zaire where the refugees come from (6), implying efforts to promote repatriation on their part. While the Government will no doubt welcome the news that some Zairean refugees are already planning to return home, there is little reason to believe that the mass of refugees will return in the near future.   REFERENCES  1. A simple addition of all the refugees in camps in Tanzania gives a total figure of about 368,000 refugees at the end of March 1997. Of this number, 90,000 are Zaireans and 278,000 are Burundians. Before the influxes which began in November 1996, there were an estimated 50,000 Burundian refugees in Kigoma region and there are 101,000 refugees in Greater Lukole camp, Ngara District, Kagera region. They were joined by about 90,000 Zaireans arriving in Tanzania between November and the end of March, and about 115,000 Burundians coming directly from Burundi. In addition, some 9,700 Burundians arrived from Zaire as well as 2,200 Rwandans (subsequently repatriated to Rwanda).   2.

Since November 1996 the number of refugees in Kigoma region has escalated from 50,000 Burundian refugees to 267,000 refugees of Burundian and Zairean nationality today. The recent influx brings the total number of refugees in Tanzania to about 368,000, including the refugees already living in Ngara district of Kagera region (1). The sheer scale of the influxes prompted emergency interventions by relief agencies and the temporary creation of transit centres. Today, the agencies are in the process of extending existing sites to accomodate the refugees and developing a new camp at Lugufu.   2. This situation report follows a recent DHA/IRIN field visit to the districts of Kigoma, Kasulu and Kibondo in Kigoma region and Ngara in Kagera region. It describes the circumstances leading to the arrival of this recent wave of refugees, the ways they are assisted on arrival and conditions in refugee camps to which they are being transferred. It also decribes conditions in, and issues relating to, the older refugee camps. The report concludes by assessing the attitude of the Government of Tanzania to the latest waves of arrivals in Kigoma region. A map of the camps in Kigoma region is available from IRIN by fax or e-mail (GIF format) or on DHA ReliefWeb's site.   THE ARRIVAL OF REFUGEES FROM ZAIRE  3. Since November about 90,000 Zaireans have entered Tanzania seeking protection, coming from the Uvira, Baraka and Fizi regions along the shores of Lake Tanganyika. They have been joined by about 9,700 Burundians and 2,200 Rwandans who had been refugees in camps near Uvira. The first arrivals came by boat and arrived near Kigoma town on 2 November, fleeing fighting between rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) and the Zairean Army. Within days, Burundian and Rwandan refugees from Zaire began to arrive. During the month of November as a whole, 29,000 Zaireans arrived in Kigoma region as well as 5,000 Burundian and 1,800 Rwandan refugees from Zaire.   4. The influx from Zaire has continued ever since, with a further 10,000 Zaireans arriving in December, 24,000 in January, 26,000 in February and 8,700 in March. In February, the fall of the town of Kalemie to the ADFL lead to an influx of Zaireans from the Kalemie area to Kigoma; today they respresent about 1% of the total Zairean caseload. The influx of Burundian and Rwandan refugees from Zaire tailed off rapidly, with 3,000 Burundians arriving in December, 950 in January, 500 in February and 140 in March, while 370 Rwandans arrived in December and less than 30 have been registered since then. It should be noted that Burundian arrivals from Zaire are here treated distinctly from Burundian arrivals coming directly into Tanzania from Burundi, who are dealt with in the following section.   5. The reasons given by Zaireans for leaving their country relate directly to the conflict between ADFL rebels and Government troops and the progressive takeover of eastern Zaire by the rebel forces. During November the main reasons the refugees gave for leaving were fighting between ADFL forces and Government troops and insecurity created by fleeing Government soldiers. As the rebels established control over Uvira and extended their territory south down the western shore of Lake Tanganyika, a new set of concerns arose. Zaireans from the area left because they feared being caught up in a Zairean Government counter-offensive or being forcibly enlisted into ADFL ranks.   6. Some of the refugees were simply uncertain of how the conflict would evolve, and decided to come to Tanzania to bide their time until the situation had normalized, while others foresaw the rebel takeover of the whole territory along the Lake. The vast majority of Zairean refugees in Tanzania come from the Bembe ethnic group (2), which have had a tense relationship with the Banyamulenge community in Zaire and sided with Government forces against the ADFL in fighting during November and December 1996 (3). Zaireans continue to arrive in Kigoma, with the number varying from a little as 79 a day (27/3) to 303 (31/3). They cite continuing insecurity in the Fizi area as their reason for leaving. The Burundian and Rwandan refugees who left in November and December feared staying in an area under ADFL control and chose to go to Tanzania rather than returning to their countries of origin.   7. The vast majority of Zaireans arriving in Tanzania either made their own way towards Kigoma town or were picked up from the lakeshore in Tanzania by UNHCR boats. Many paid for their boat fares of $10 and brought possessions with them, indicating their status as former urbanites. Three transit centres were established within Kigoma town to cater for the new arrivals, as initially there was insufficient capacity within existing camps to accomodate them. These centres swelled rapidly in size, and at their peak in early February were home to about 32,000 people. This also slowed down the transfer of refugees from the lakeshore to the centres themselves.   8. Although health screenings, immunizations and interventions to provide water and sanitation, food, accomodation and non-food items were swiftly undertaken by UNICEF, WFP, IRC, Caritas, WorldVision and MSF-Spain, under UNHCR's coordination, a cholera outbreak and wider concerns about public health conditions in the overcrowded sites prompted efforts to accelerate the development of the identified contingency sites. A small minority of the refugees, estimated to be less than 10,000, initially went to stay in lakeshore villages, living among friends or relatives. About 4,800 people of these people living along the lakeshore are reported to have gone back to Uvira on their own initiative.   9. Zairean refugees were first transferred to Nyaragusu, a site in Kasulu district originally chosen to house Burundian refugees. Since February, Zaireans have been transferred to Lugufu, a new camp being developed about 85 kms east of Kigoma town. As of 11 March this site accomodated some 45,000 refugees. Burundian refugees have been directed to the Mtabila and Muyovosi camps in Kasulu district, while the small number of Rwandans, living in one of the transit centres in Kigoma town or in Mkugwa camp in Kibondo district, were subsequently repatriated as part of Tanzanian Government's repatriation of Rwandan refugees in December 1996. Refugees requiring medical treatments unavailable in the transit centres were referred to three hospitals in Kigoma town, while cholera cases were dealt with at the cholera centres in one of the transit camps or Ujiji hospital, supported by UNICEF and MSF-Spain. By the end of March, two of the three transit camps had closed down altogether, while the third site, the stadium, housed only 688 relatives of 229 Zairean soldiers who arrived in February.   THE CAMPS FOR ZAIREAN REFUGEES  10. Nyaragusu: This camp, home to 45,000 Zairean refugees, is located in Kasulu district, 55 kms north of Kasulu town. An estimated 70% of the refugees are from Fizi, while the rest are from the Uvira area. The camp is situated in a flat, wooded area and divided up into villages with refugees inhabiting small houses, built from wood and mud, with plastic sheets for roofing. The refugees receive 13 litres of water per person per day and an estimated 1900 kcal from their food basket. The refugees complain both about the quantity and type of food they are given, as they are used to fish and manioc, and several security incidents in relation to this have taken place, the most recent being a riot on 22 March. The main agencies in the camp are UNHCR, WFP, UNICEF, WorldVision (camp management), AEF (Africa Educational Fund, responsible for health care), OXFAM (water and sanitation), and Christian Outreach (social services).   11. Some 3,000 people in Nyaragusu have registered to return to Zaire, most of them to the Uvira area. When questioned about this, they replied that they had heard that the situation in Uvira is quite stable and they are unhappy about staying on because of the conditions in the camp, particularly in relation to food. A young man from Uvira, who came to Tanzania in late November by walking south and paying $10 for a boat trip to Kigoma, complained about the lack of food and said he wanted to return. An elderly woman from Fizi, who left Zaire in late October with some members of her family, said that some people wanted to return because of the lack of food but that she preferred to stay because there are 'still problems in Zaire'. She said she was afraid of the Banyamulenge.   12. Lugufu: This recently established camp is now home to 45,000 Zairean refugees and is located 85 kms east of Kigoma town. The camp is situated in a swampy area and refugees are currently living directly under plastic sheets propped up by pieces of wood. The camp has been severely affected by the onset of the rains and the ground is permanently wet, with some sites provisionally allocated for villages having had to be abandoned due to being waterlogged. The food ration for the refugees, at an estimated 1200-1600 kcal per day, reflects the difficulties WFP has experienced in transporting food to the camp. This is the result of a shortage of trucks and the extremely poor road conditions in the vicinity, which are often impassable now the rains are underway.   13. The water supply situation in the camp is very poor, with the IFRC currently relying on tankers to bring water from the outskirts of the camp, where it is being pumped from a small river and treated. Due to the poor road conditions, the arrival of the tankers is being interrupted, resulting in water shortages for the refugees, who receive only 6.2 - 6.7 litres per person per day. During the course of the mission, a riot about water took place in the camp, forcing the temporary evacuation of staff. The public health situation is a cause for serious concern, as the camp is overwhelmingly dependent on communal latrines, with only 24 family latrines having been constructed. Combined with the water shortages, the water-logged ground and lack of adequate drainage, the health of the refugees is a growing concern for the agencies working in the camp.   THE ARRIVAL OF REFUGEES FROM BURUNDI   14. During November 1996 63,000 Burundians fled Burundi and arrived in Kigoma region, 50,000 of them in Kibondo district. Since then the number of new arrivals has diminished; with 22,000 in December, 16,000 in January, 9,000 in February and 5,500 in March. There have been two previous influxes of Burundians into Tanzania. The first took place in 1972; the second was in 1994 following the killing of President Ndadaye. The influx of November 1996 was preceded by smaller influxes throughout the earlier part of the year. When, in December 1996, the Tanzania Government repatriated all the Rwandan refugees in Tanzania, the Burundians were allowed to remain, in recognition of the insecurity in Burundi.   15. Many of the arrivals since November come from Ruyigi and Rutana districts in Burundi, which border Tanzania, but interviews in the camps suggest Burundians are arriving from all parts of the country, including Gitega, Karuzi, Bujumbura and even Bururi and Cibitoke. The refugees are exclusively of Hutu ethnicity and are nearly all from rural areas, unlike the Zairean refugees who are mostly from urban or semi-urban places. The vast majority of Burundian and Zairean refugees in all the camps in Kigoma region are women and children.   16. Arrivals of Burundian refugees in Tanzania in the latter half of 1996 relate to the changing climate in Burundi since Major Buyoya's coup in July, but the November influx appears to have been caused by an escalation in the conflict between October and December, with the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Burundi, Paulo Serghio Pinheiro, reporting that during this period both the army and rebel groups took advantage of the conflict in eastern Zaire to launch new offensives. In particular, there is evidence that the break-up of the refugee camps near Uvira led some Burundian rebels to enter the country, causing an escalation in fighting. The Special Rapporteur also reports that large numbers of Burundian rebels, including their general staff, fled the camps in eastern Zaire and relocated to Tanzania (4).   17. On arriving in Tanzania, Burundian refugees are directed from UNHCR's assembly points straight to the refugee camps. Most new arrivals have gone to three camps; Mtendeli in Kibondo district and the recently established camps in Kasulu district, while others have been settled in extensions of older sites. Many of the refugees arriving in Tanzania are in poor health, with children showing signs of malnutrition. This suggests that some of them may have spent considerable periods of time displaced from their homes prior to crossing the border. The following section describes the recently established camps as well as the older camps in Kasulu, Kibondo and Ngara districts, home to Burundian refugees who fled previous escalations in fighting.   THE CAMPS FOR BURUNDIAN REFUGEES  18. The camps in Kasulu and Kibondo districts are all located to either side of the main road linking Kasulu town with Kibondo town and Ngara town. This road lies between 20 and 40 kms away from the border and runs almost its whole length. The road is in very poor condition and large stretches are flooded during the current rainy season. For this reason, major logistical problems affect all of the camps and cause shortages in, for example, the supply of non-food items.   19. The older camps (Mtabila in Kasulu, Kanembwa and Mkugwa in Kibondo) originated in 1994 and are more settled than the camps established in 1996 (Nyaragusu in Kasulu and Mtendeli and and Nduta in Kibondo). All of the camps are home to Burundian refugees, with the exception of Nyaragusu (see above) and Mkugwa, which is a special case (see below). The difference between the age of their camps is reflected in their facilities; refugees in the older camps benefit from access to limited agricultural land and some permanent structures for community based education. In the new camps refugees do not have access to land or formal education, as the Tanzanian Government argues these will encourage refugees to stay for the long-term.   20. The common health complaints in all of the camps are malaria and anaemia. Refugees who require medical treatments that cannot be given in the camps are referred to the district hospitals in Kasulu and Kibondo towns. These are being rehabilitated under Swiss Cooperation in Kibondo, while MSF-Spain provides material support to those hospitals. An issue affecting the areas around all the camps is the environmental damage caused by refugees, particularly the cutting down of trees. UNDP recently organized assessment missions to Kigoma and Kagera regions to investigate the situation and is in the process of establishing a programme to rehabilitate the refugee-affected areas. CARE has already embarked on a project to rehabilitate the sites of former refugee camps in Ngara and will assess, in consultation with UNHCR and camp management NGOs, the type of environmental activities required for Kigoma.   21. The main UN agencies and NGOs working in the camps are UNHCR, WFP, UNICEF, the IFRC and the Tanzanian Red Cross (health services), Oxfam UK and Ireland (water and sanitation), International Rescue Committee (health services), the ICRC (tracing), Tanganyika Christian Refugee Service (various sectors including camp management and agriculture), Christian Outreach (community services), AFRICARE (community services), Disaster Relief Agency (community services) and CARE (environmental protection).   KASULU DISTRICT  22. Moyovosi: This camp was established last year, is home to 40,000 Burundian refugees and is located 42 kms north of Kasulu town. The camp, situated across a stretch of low-lying hills, has the appearance of a village, with refugees living in small mud houses with roofs of plastic sheeting. Water is pumped from a nearby stream and refugees receive 15-20 litres per person per day, while Oxfam are also in the process of establishing a gravity system for the camp. The IFRC and the Tanzanian Red Cross are responsible for supplementary and therapeutic feeding in the camp.   23. Mtabila: The original camp was opened in March 1994 but has recently been extended to accomodate recent arrivals from Burundi. The camp is home to 33,000 refugees of Burundian nationality, and is situated right next to Muyovosi, some 35 kms from Kasulu town. The camp has the appearance of a normal rural settlement. In terms of water, refugees receive 30 litres per person per day in the original site, although it appears that this figure does not apply to the extension where difficulties in establishing water systems are being experienced.   KIBONDO DISTRICT  24. Mtendeli: Mtendeli was first established in July 1996 and until November was home to 11,000 Burundian refugees. Following the November influx into Kibondo District the camp population increased and now stands at 66,000 after refugees were transferred to Nduta in order to try and decongest the camp. The refugees come from the provinces of Ruyigi, Cankuzo, Karuzi and Muyinga. The camp is located 38 kms north-east of Kibondo town and is situated in a wooded area. The main problem in the camp is the shortage of water, currently supplied from streams at 6 litres per person per day, while the Tanganyika Christian Refugee Service (TCRS) continues to drill for water. In terms of food, the refugees receive a ration of 1,551 kcal per person per day. As in other recently established camps, formal education is not allowed by the authorities but the DRA is assisting community based initiatives. Some 1,000 refugees have registered to return to Burundi.   25. Nduta: Established in December 1996, this is the newest camp in the district and is currently receiving all new arrivals from Burundi. It has a population of 17,800 Burundian refugees, who come from Ruyigi, Cankuzo and Gitega provinces. Located 29 kms south-east of Kibondo town, the camp is situated in a flat, wooded area. Water, provided by Oxfam, is pumped from two nearby streams. Most camp structures are temporary and the long-term future of the camp is uncertain as the Government of Tanzania has had second thoughts about the location of the camp, which is only 6 kms away from a National Reserve. It seems likely that the size of the camp will remain small.   26. Mkugwa: This camp was established in March 1994 and caters only for 'special protection cases', mainly Burundians in mixed ethnicity marriages. At present there are 1,012 people living in the camp, of whom 786 are Burundians, 201 Rwandans in mixed ethnicity marriages and 25 Banyamulenge from eastern Zaire. The camp is located 45 kms south of Kibondo town and has the appearance of a normal rural settlement. Water is provided from a borehole, run by TCRS, which supplies 14 litres per person per day. Refugees receive a food basket of 1,839 kcal per person. The IRC run a health clinic in the camp and a supplementary feeding programme, and are responsible for community services, which include a self reliance programme and adult education for literacy, while a primary school is run by TCRS.   27. The Rwandans have formally requested asylum and are currently awaiting a decision from the Tanzanian Government. They are all in mixed marriages and say they are afraid to go back to Rwanda. The Banyamulenge come from Uvira and fled south to Kalemie with the local population before crossing to Kigoma by boat. On arrival in Kigoma they said they were afraid of staying in the same place as the other Zairean refugees. The Banyamulenge say they would like to go to Rwanda (this group is reported to consider themselves Rwandans) and UNHCR has made representations to the Tanzanian Government to explore this possibility with the Rwandan authorities.   28. Kanembwa: This camp was also established in March 1994 and is the most settled of all the Kibondo camps, with refugees enjoying relatively large plots and having access to 6,000 acres for agriculture. Located only 15 kms north of Kibondo town, the camp has the appearance of a rural settlement, with the benefit of permanent buildings including primary and secondary schools. The camp is home to 19,000 Burundians. WFP continues to supply food to the camp, which is supplemented by food cultivated by the refugees.   NGARA DISTRICT  29. Greater Lukole: As of the end of November 1996 some 82,000 Burundians were already living in three camps in Ngara district, Musuhura (2,300), Lukole (20,000) and Kitali (60,000). Following the Tanzanian Government's repatriation of Rwandan refugees, the Government decided that all Burundian refugees should be in one camp. The site chosen was Lukole, and as a first step the refugees from Kitale were transferred. According to the March 1997 verification, the camp population of Greater Lukole is now 101,000. Agencies are still in the process of scaling up to meet the increased demands, particularly in terms of health and sanitation. There is also an old refugee settlement called Burugi in Muleba District which is currently accomodating 249 Burundian refugees who fled to Tanzania before October 1993.   30. Following the mass repatriation of Rwandan refugees in December 1996 the Government of Tanzania launched an anti-illegal immigrant operation throughout the country. In Ngara between January and March the policy resulted in the uprooting and forcible relocation of over 13,000 Burundians into Greater Lukole camp from Tanzanian villages. This caseload was composed of Burundian migrants and refugees who had spontaneously settled in Tanzanian villages contrary to Government directives that all refugees from Burundi had to stay in designated camps. A large number of the uprooted Burundians were inter-married with Tanzanian nationals or children of such unions.   31. There is a high level of tension in Greater Lukole camp due to the presence of activists of opposing Burundian political factions. Prior to the relocation of Burundian refugees to Lukole from Kitale Hills camp in late December and early January, there was an outbreak of inter-refugee politically motivated violence, during which at least 12 refugees were killed and over three hundred were injured. According to police investigations it appeared that the majority of the victims had been refugees accused of being sympathetic to the CNDD. The authorities attributed the violence to supporters of the PALIPEHUTU. In subsequent police action over 200 refugees suspected of involvement in the Kitali Hills violence were arrested and 126 of them were refouled to Burundi where they reportedly were summarily killed by the Burundian military at the Kobero Border Post on 10 January 1997. In light of international criticism and condemnation over the killings, the Government of Tanzania undertook not to forcibly return any refugees to Burundi in future. However, political tension amongst the refugees in Lukole persists.   32. General security in Ngara District and in the camp has deteriorated following the mass repatriation to Rwanda, as some of the Rwandans who avoided the repatriation fled to the forests. Some of these Rwandans are reportedly implicated in the rise in armed robberies and criminal attacks on the local population that is causing some families to be displaced. This increase in crime is also attributed to the sudden and drastic scaling down of refugee programmes and the attendant unemployment and shrinking of economic opportunities.   33. Since January 1997 there has been an increase in the spontaneous repatriation of Burundian refugees. To date at least 9,000 refugees have spontaneously returned to Geteranyi Commune, Muyinga Province. This movement is still continuing and usually takes place at night and through informal border crossing points. The Tanzanian Government, however, directed at the beginning of April that henceforth all movements would be through the official border at Kabanga/Kobero Border Post.   THE ATTITUDE OF THE TANZANIAN GOVERNMENT  34. Despite the fact that Tanzania has for a long time declared its border with Burundi closed for new arrivals, the Tanzanian authorities have continued to allow Burundians fleeing the conflict in their country to seek asylum in Tanzania. The same has been true for the recent influx of refugees from Zaire. There has, however, been a shift on the part of the Government towards not allowing camp conditions at a level that will, they argue, encourage refugees to stay in the long-term. This is why the the Government is unwilling to allow, in the recently created camps, the creation of permanent structures for schools, the hiring of teachers in the camps, income-generating activities or farming.   35. The siting of Lugufu camp in its inappropriate location (see above), may also be an indication that the Government is keen for Zairean refugees not to stay in the medium-term. Senior Government officials also insist that no additional sites for new arrivals be allocated but rather that plot sites in existing camps like Mtabila and Kanembwa be further reduced to cater for newly arrived refugees.   36. Tanzanians from Kigoma and Kagera regions are quick to point out that the massive presence of refugees has placed additional pressures on the area. Roads, for example, have been damaged by the large trucks used to transport both refugees and relief, while the presence of refugees has lead to increased insecurity and enviromental destruction. As relief agencies have come in to assist, there have also been price rises in several sectors. On the other hand, relief agencies have also implemented programmes that benefit local people, such as the rehabilitation of district hospitals and the improvement of roads and other infrastructure. Kigoma is the second poorest region in Tanzania (after Coast region), lagging behind the rest of the country in terms of health, education and infrastructure.   37. The Vice-President in a recent visit to Kasulu district called for Burundian refugees to return home (5), although in his subsequent visit to Kibondo he reassured refugees that they will not be coerced to repatriate as long as the situation in Burundi is not condusive. The Tanzanian Government has made it known that it will establish its own contacts with Laurent Kabila, leader of the ADFL, as de facto controller of those parts of Zaire where the refugees come from (6), implying efforts to promote repatriation on their part. While the Government will no doubt welcome the news that some Zairean refugees are already planning to return home, there is little reason to believe that the mass of refugees will return in the near future.   REFERENCES  1. A simple addition of all the refugees in camps in Tanzania gives a total figure of about 368,000 refugees at the end of March 1997. Of this number, 90,000 are Zaireans and 278,000 are Burundians. Before the influxes which began in November 1996, there were an estimated 50,000 Burundian refugees in Kigoma region and there are 101,000 refugees in Greater Lukole camp, Ngara District, Kagera region. They were joined by about 90,000 Zaireans arriving in Tanzania between November and the end of March, and about 115,000 Burundians coming directly from Burundi. In addition, some 9,700 Burundians arrived from Zaire as well as 2,200 Rwandans (subsequently repatriated to Rwanda).   2.

SECTORAL OVERVIEW II.GEORGIACOUNTRY OVERVIEWSECTORAL OVERVIEW I.SECTORAL OVERVIEW II.ANNEX I. ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMSINTRODUCTION 1. The United Nations Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for the Southern Caucasus ended as of 31 May 1997. The United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), in close collaboration with the respective governments of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, donors, UN Agencies, non-governmental and international organisations (NGOs/IOs), concluded that a new humanitarian appeal for the region would not be issued. The countries no longer face the severe, economic, and social problems which beset them and the emergency situation that affected millions of citizens has, on the whole, been alleviated. While there remain humanitarian needs which will, in the short-term, require continued support from donors, future humanitarian programmes require formulation within a broad development context. Development with an emphasis on poverty alleviation has become the priority for the region. Development donors and agencies, therefore, are called on to increase their capacity. 2. The three governments are in the process of elaborating their respective development strategies, future priorities and UN assistance needs in Country Strategy Notes (CSNs). These country specific-papers will also address outstanding humanitarian issues such as those in areas of unresolved conflict or by targeting groups with specific needs. Thus the establishment of a new framework for the provision of humanitarian assistance is in the process of emerging in the southern Caucasus, which will supersede the DHA-facilitated consolidated appeal process. 3. DHA, having played a pivotal role throughout the region during the past three years, is now analysing its future role in the region. Over the next six months one of the Department's key functions will be to oversee the completion of the consolidated humanitarian appeal process and the establishment of a cohesive link with the CSNs. This document, Post-Appeal Framework: Linking Humanitarian Needs and Development Strategies, is the first step in that process. Furthermore, it may be appropriate that the Department maintain a regional presence beyond 1997 to facilitate the coordination of outstanding humanitarian programmes, especially in areas of unresolved conflict. DHA also envisages other areas of activity which are outlined in the course of this paper.REGIONAL OVERVIEW 1. The humanitarian situation in the southern Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia) has, since 1991, been characterised as an emergency. DHA, at the request of the respective governments, established a presence in the region in 1993. Since that time DHA has launched three United Nations Inter-Agency Consolidated Appeals (1994-5, 1995-6, 1996-7). The Appeals highlighted ongoing humanitarian needs, in the context of the emergency situations, in the three Caucasus countries, and have sought funds for the agencies of the United Nations System, as well as NGOs and IOs addressing these needs. 2. The appeal process rendered considerable assistance to donors by providing them with a vehicle for decision-making for allocation of resources. It has also served the implementing organisations by presenting emergency needs in a consolidated and rational manner. In the last Appeal, which ran from June 1996 to May 1997, a number of projects related to rehabilitation and reconstruction activities were included, in recognition of the fact that the emergency phase of the operation was drawing to a close. However, ongoing humanitarian needs remained in all three countries and ongoing donor support to meet these needs has been crucial. Linked to this has been the emergence of development-related activities, as manifested by the increasing presence, at the macro-level, of organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). An increase in allocation of resources by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for development-related activities and the enhanced use of the World Food Programme (WFP)'s Food for Work (FFW) programmes are further indicators that development-related activities are ever more relevant in the context of the three countries. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has addressed the longer-term development and capacity-building concerns in the sectors of health, education and special needs of children through its Country Programmes since 1993 in Armenia and Azerbaijan, and since 1994 in Georgia. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) also has shifted considerable resources to programmes that support self-reliance, income generation and local capacity building among internally displaced persons (IDPs) and institutions that support them. 3. The implementation of macro-economic reforms, combined with the transformation of the economies of the three countries from centrally-planned to market-oriented, is exacting a price from their populations. Whilst markets begin to react positively to the reform process, the collapse of the previously comprehensive social safety net leaves many in difficult circumstances. The lack of an adequate tax base and fully-functioning taxation system dictates that the government must allocate scarce resources as effectively as possible. However, lack of revenue from taxation means that most sectoral budgets remain only partly funded. Those worst affected by the reforms are those who are least likely to be able to support themselves. 4. The problems in the social sector are well recognised by the governments of the three countries, all of whom are making strenuous efforts to formulate new social protection mechanisms which are able to operate within the constraints of a market-oriented economy. Such a task is not easy, since it requires the rebuilding of structures and mechanisms and extensive investment in training and resources. In the short-term, ongoing humanitarian assistance is required to support those people who are classified as most vulnerable. In the long term, it is anticipated that the three countries will be in a position to provide effective support to the elderly, the disabled, refugees and IDPs and other population groups of concern. Much of development assistance is targeted at capacity and institution building for state and non-state mechanisms mandated to assist and support those people who remain in need. Support is also needed at regional level for specific sectors such as shelter, education, health (particularly mental, reproductive and child health, as well as the establishment of effective health information systems) and employment creation, in which humanitarian and development agencies, supported by both humanitarian and development arms of donor governments, need to collaborate even more closely. 5. While the emergency situation may be regarded as over, clearly defined humanitarian needs remain. Moreover, the final resolution of the three major conflicts which resulted in the massive displacement of populations in the sub-region, i.e., Abkhazia, Tskhinvali (South Ossetia) and Nagorno-Karabakh, remains elusive. The success of various peace efforts in the region will be pivotal in ensuring durable solutions to the humanitarian crisis. It is proposed that the provision of assistance to meet these needs be undertaken in the context of a development framework. To this end, and in recognition of the need to move forward with the development agenda, the UN System in the three southern Caucasus countries, under the coordination of UNDP, is in the process of supporting the governments to elaborate the respective CSNs. This document, compiled by the respective governments in cooperation with the UN System, is designed to reflect the development needs of the country, whilst ensuring continued emphasis on ongoing unmet humanitarian needs. The CSN process provides government, donors and the UN System with the opportunity to work in cooperation and collaboration in the identification of needs which cross-cut the humanitarian and developmental agendas. As such, it is a document which provides a comprehensive overview of current requirements. 6. DHA is working in close cooperation with UN Agencies as well as the wider humanitarian and development community to ensure that ongoing humanitarian needs are reflected and highlighted in the context of a development framework. Continued dialogue with donors, provision of information related to the humanitarian needs and programmes, humanitarian advocacy and diplomacy in the region and advocacy work and support for the strengthening of the social welfare sector are foreseen as part of DHA's ongoing strategy in the southern Caucasus for the remainder of 1997 and possibly beyond. The table overleaf illustrates total humanitarian aid to the Caucasus from April 1994 to May 1997. 7. While the CSN documents, to be completed by September of this year, will provide a comprehensive overview of requirements, donor funding for the most critical remaining humanitarian needs during the remainder of 1997 and possibly beyond, will be required before then. These needs are broadly outlined below and will be specifically brought forward by the relevant agencies in the form of more detailed requests. In this regard, DHA will continue to monitor and support these fund-raising efforts for the region, as well as to provide and maintain a consolidation of UN humanitarian activities. 8. It is also important to note that each of the three countries were active participants to the UNHCR/International Organization for Migration (IOM)-facilitated Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) Conference held in May 1996. Consequently, a parallel and supportive process to the CSN is ongoing to develop National Implementation Plans (NIPs) in the framework of the follow-up to the Conference. On the basis of a joint strategy, IOM and UNHCR have launched an Appeal in 1997 to support CIS governments' efforts to implement the Programme ofAction adopted by the Conference, which include strong capacity-building activities, as well as other important assistance components. In this context, a special follow-on Appeal may be required to reflect and emphasize UNHCR/IOM funding needs for the Caucasus Region.  ARMENIACOUNTRY OVERVIEW 1. During the last three years, Armenia has undertaken radical reforms in order to transform its political and economic environment into one which supports and sustains market-oriented growth. The initiation of the reform process, with support from the IMF, the World Bank and bilateral donors can now be seen to be having some positive results. Economic growth has been recorded at approximately five percent per year since 1994, following a reduction in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of nearly 90 percent over the previous two years. Infrastructural improvements can be noted and the flow of money in the economy has increased. Concurrently, the recommissioning of the Metsamor nuclear power plant has helped to provide 24-hour electricity to the majority of households in the country and is expected to support the establishment of new industrial infrastructure. 2. The PAROS vulnerability index, recently upgraded and streamlined, provides an estimate that 400,000 people remain either vulnerable or critically vulnerable. Recent findings by the Ministry of Social Welfare, UNHCR and a local NGO, Mission Armenia, found that 3,000 elderly people remain alone and without any form of support within the city limits of Yerevan. A joint survey by the European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO), in collaboration with UNICEF and other partners, undertaken in June 1996, indicates that 17 percent of the population remains medically vulnerable. Of this, four percent are regarded as extremely vulnerable. WFP continues to provide food aid to 220,000 people, of whom 90,000 are refugees, and many of whom are still, after eight years, living in temporary accommodation. 3. Elaboration and implementation of an effective social safety net aimed at meeting the needs of the more vulnerable members of the population is now one of the main priorities of the government and, increasingly, the development agencies. The European Union Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States (EU/TACIS) has provided ECU 1,000,000 for capacity building of the Ministry of Social Welfare. The World Bank is providing credits for wide-ranging reforms to the education system, with support also from other donors. The Bank is also providing assistance for health system reforms. Such provision of assistance indicates that there is an increased emphasis on ensuring that the country succeeds not only economically, but also with regard to ensuring that basic human rights and needs are met in the newly emerging state. 4. Such reforms and capacity-building exercises are urgently required. However, their successful implementation relies on careful planning and execution and, in the longer term, increased funding from government sources. One example of the recently improved collaboration in this area is the ongoing establishment of closer ties between the government and the non-governmental sector. Such work is ensuring that needs are met. A recent initiative by EU/TACIS, the German NGO Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), DHA, and UNHCR to consolidate and plan assistance to theMinistry of Social Welfare in both the humanitarian and development sectors is beginning to show dividends in terms of a planned division of labour. Another is the establishment of a working group on education reform with participants from the Ministry of Education and Science, the Bretton Woods institutions and the UN Agencies, the non-governmental sector and others. This group focuses on the reform process including drafting of legislation and raising funds to meet the immediate needs for publication of school textbooks. Data collection and analysis also assists with coordination efforts. UNDP's activities in relation to poverty and public awareness, surveys of the informal sector and work on gender awareness also form part of this newly emerging strategy. 5. There is general recognition that effective work is reliant upon close coordination and cooperation between the government, the development agencies, the humanitarian agencies and the non-governmental sector. The UN System is now supporting the elaboration of a CSN formulated by the government in cooperation with the UN Agencies, the donors and other partners. The aim and intention of this document is to outline the assistance to be provided by the UN during the next three years. The document will be designed to cover both the developmental and humanitarian needs of the country. 6. The Government of Armenia has indicated that, although there are outstanding humanitarian needs in Armenia, they no longer constitute an emergency situation. However, careful targeting of assistance for particular vulnerable groups is a strong government priority. These views are shared by the Agencies of the UN System and bilateral and multilateral agencies. However, the need for ongoing humanitarian support as the government and people of Armenia focus on longer-term poverty alleviation and development strategies should be recognised by the donor community. Indeed, the implementation of the reform programmes can be seen, in some cases, to be increasing the levels of hardship for the vulnerable population. On a sectoral basis identified needs remain. The next few pages will present a brief overview of the sectors in which humanitarian requirements continue as the country undertakes policy initiatives aimed to mitigate the still pressing needs of a population undergoing the difficult but necessary process of political, economic and social transformation.SECTOR OVERVIEW I.Agriculture 7. Development assistance to the agricultural sector has increased during the last 12 months. Inputs have been provided by the United States Department for Agriculture (USDA) to assist with marketing, the establishment of the Armenian Farmers Credit Bank by EU/TACIS, US$ 43,000,000 of credits from the World Bank to support the irrigation sector and support from UNDP, UNHCR and WFP. 8. The agricultural sector is becoming increasingly framed in a development context, with assistance for increasing yields, introduction of new technologies and environmentally-friendly practices high on the agenda of the Ministry of Agriculture and those organisations and agencies concerned. To this end the Humanitarian Assistance Commission (HAC) of the Government has stated that agriculture is no longer seen to be an emergency or humanitarian need.Capacity Building and Coordination 9. IOM's long-term Capacity Building in Migration Management Programme is now in the implementation phase. Government reorganisation has located responsibility for migration under the Ministry of Social Welfare. In close cooperation with UNHCR and the government, this important programme is designed to ensure the establishment of a unified migration management programme and the building of government capacity to manage it. Given the potential for renewed movements of people within the CIS and from other countries, the establishment of such a programme will ensure improved government capacity to handle humanitarian crises involving migratory movements. 10. IOM's Migration Sector Development Project (MSDP) seeks to assist in the strengthening and self-development of the Armenian national NGO sector, in a manner consistent with the principles declared in the CIS Conference Programme of Action.  Similar projects are currently being undertaken by IOM in Georgia and Azerbaijan, with the shared goal of overall strengthening of the Transcaucasus regional network of migration sector national NGOs. An important feature of the project is the provision of small grants for self-development to individual NGOs. Funding thus far has been provided from unearmarked funds provided through the Appeal, but additional funding is required to complete all the goals of this project. UNHCR's follow-up to the CIS Conference held in May 1996 in the field of capacity building includes capacity building assistance to NGOs. UN Agencies also, as part of their programme activities, encourage the capacity building of national NGOs and, by implication, the strengthening of an active civil society. 11. UNDP's Democracy and Governance Programme aims to support capacity building of the ministries of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Economy. UNDP assistance is also envisaged to support the capacity of the Presidency. 12. UNICEF's programmes for capacity building and support for reforms in the health and education sectors are focused on development of skills in programme planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Assistance includes training of administrators, health workers and teachers. Emphasis is also placed on improving the quality and relevance of basic health and education services. UNICEF, UNDP and World Bank credits are also supporting the training of school headmasters to promote decentralised management and community involvement in schools. 13. The USAID-funded NGO Centre, operated by the Armenian Assembly of America (AAA) has supported the training of national NGOs. New directions for the Centre include convening of fora and discussions involving government, international organisations and NGOs to examine more effective modalities of cooperation for humanitarian and development activities. 14. DHA's role with regard to coordination is now being enhanced with the assumption of responsibility for NGO coordination, in cooperation with UNDP. In this way, it is planned that effective mechanisms will be established across the humanitarian and development agencies leading to enhanced cooperation and coordination between the governmental and non-governmental sectors. DHA and UNDP envisage full assumption of this responsibility by UNDP by the end of 1997. DHA continues to produce a monthly situation report and has recently established the publication of a two-page in-country bulletin, both of which were widely distributed. 15. As the need for a clearly defined and accurately targeted approach to the provision of humanitarian assistance increases, an ongoing coordination role for DHA in ensuring that humanitarian assistance complements development assistance is envisaged.","Southern Caucasus Post Appeal Framework: Linking Humanitarian Needs and Development Strategies SOUTHERN CAUCASUS (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Gerogia)  June 1997  CONTENTSINTRODUCTIONREGIONAL OVERVIEW ARMENIACOUNTRY OVERVIEWSECTOR OVERVIEW I.

The United Nations Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for the Southern Caucasus ended as of 31 May 1997. The United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), in close collaboration with the respective governments of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, donors, UN Agencies, non-governmental and international organisations (NGOs/IOs), concluded that a new humanitarian appeal for the region would not be issued. The countries no longer face the severe, economic, and social problems which beset them and the emergency situation that affected millions of citizens has, on the whole, been alleviated. While there remain humanitarian needs which will, in the short-term, require continued support from donors, future humanitarian programmes require formulation within a broad development context. Development with an emphasis on poverty alleviation has become the priority for the region. Development donors and agencies, therefore, are called on to increase their capacity. 2. The three governments are in the process of elaborating their respective development strategies, future priorities and UN assistance needs in Country Strategy Notes (CSNs). These country specific-papers will also address outstanding humanitarian issues such as those in areas of unresolved conflict or by targeting groups with specific needs. Thus the establishment of a new framework for the provision of humanitarian assistance is in the process of emerging in the southern Caucasus, which will supersede the DHA-facilitated consolidated appeal process. 3. DHA, having played a pivotal role throughout the region during the past three years, is now analysing its future role in the region. Over the next six months one of the Department's key functions will be to oversee the completion of the consolidated humanitarian appeal process and the establishment of a cohesive link with the CSNs. This document, Post-Appeal Framework: Linking Humanitarian Needs and Development Strategies, is the first step in that process. Furthermore, it may be appropriate that the Department maintain a regional presence beyond 1997 to facilitate the coordination of outstanding humanitarian programmes, especially in areas of unresolved conflict. DHA also envisages other areas of activity which are outlined in the course of this paper.REGIONAL OVERVIEW 1. The humanitarian situation in the southern Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia) has, since 1991, been characterised as an emergency. DHA, at the request of the respective governments, established a presence in the region in 1993. Since that time DHA has launched three United Nations Inter-Agency Consolidated Appeals (1994-5, 1995-6, 1996-7). The Appeals highlighted ongoing humanitarian needs, in the context of the emergency situations, in the three Caucasus countries, and have sought funds for the agencies of the United Nations System, as well as NGOs and IOs addressing these needs. 2.

133,32334,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Appeal Angola Emergency Relief AFAO71," - Nzaji (Andrade) Assistance to Displaced Persons -Appeal Target : US$ 1,034,600 Dear Friends, Beginning in the middle of May of this year, government of national unity (GURN) forces and UNITA forces have clashed in the northeastern areas of Angola, especially in the province of Lunde Norte. Heavy military activities in many areas continue to be reported. The situation in the rest of Angola remains tense, with reports of both government and UNITA efforts to recruit new soldiers and reports of new supplies of arms and weapons being received by both sides. As a result of the conflict in the Lunde Norte region, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of internally displaced people (primarily women & children) fleeing the conflict zones. The total estimated number of displaced people is 30,000 at the present time. There are over 8,000 displaced persons in Nzaji town, 1,500 in the Chico Guerrero camp outside of town, and many others in the towns surrounding Nzaji. ACT member, Lutheran World Service- Angola Program (ACT/LWS) has appealed for emergency assistance for these displaced families in northeastern Angola. Targeted assistance will include the provision of tents, water, clothing, non food items, shelter materials, food and basic health requirements during a 6 month period. All appeal activities will be implemented through the established ACT/LWS Angola program and offices working in cooperation with local churches, communities and authorities, as well as in conjunction with international organizations and NGOs. We request your prompt and generous support to this vital ACT emergency relief effort to assist the families of Angola displaced by war and conflict. We thank you in advance for your support.

EMERGENCY BACKGROUND INFORMATION The recent military events ,and subsequent flight of IDPs in the Nzaji (Andrade) area of Lunda Norte province started a month after the investiture of the Government of national Unity (GURN) in Angola. Since that time there has been a constant influx of internally displaced people (IDPs) into the Nzaji area. According to UN sources, tensions are high in areas recently taken by government forces from UNITA. Hundreds of people are still moving north to Nzaji to escape the fighting in their villages. As of mid-July over 8,000 IDPs had been registered in Nzaji town, with over 1,300 staying the IDP camp just outside of town. LWF/WS-Angola began working in Lunda Norte in early 1994, with the support of Church Action Angola (CAA), a consortium of European and Angolan churches. The Angolan government, via the Ministry of Social Reintegration (MINARS) approached LWF/WS-Angola to provide post-war relief assistance in the area. Following a needs assessment with the local communities and local authorities, LWF/WS began to distribute food (provided by WFP and other donors) and non-food items (provided mostly by the LWF system), out of its base in Dundo, to the affected population- which included over 50,000 displaced people. Operations were extended to Nzaji in September 1995, also to provide relief assistance to displaced populations there. Since that time, LWF/WS-Angola has gradually transformed its programme from strictly relief to one oriented towards rehabilitation and assisting people to return and reintegrate to their home community. This is being accomplished through projects geared to promote and improve livelihood, security and self sufficiency such as agriculture, repair of social infrastructure, community health and sanitation, skills training, and assistance to vulnerable groups. Throughout all projects, LWF/WS-Angola maintains its working relationship through its primary partners which are the communities themselves, local churches and the local authorities. The programme and the projects reflect the theme that the best solution in emergency and relief situations is to assist people to return and resettle back to their home communities as soon as it is feasible, and to strengthen the communities’ capacity to regain their livelihood and dignity. LWF/WS-Angola has been able to build up good relations with the local communities, churches, and authorities (with the government and UNITA). In this manner, assistance has been able to reach those most in need, in both government and UNITA controlled areas. With the recent IDP situation in Nzaji, LWF/WS-Angola has been able to immediately provide relief assistance to over 8,000 displaced in the Nzaji area from its Nzaji office. Using its staff and other resources, LWF/WS-Angola, with MINARS, has been able to register the IDPs and provide shelter, non-food items, basic health and logistics assistance to over 1,300 persons in the displaced camp at Chico Guerreiro. Food rations have been provided by WFP. LWF/WS-Angola has also been able to provide some logistics support to other agencies who have arrived in the area to support the relief efforts. II. CURRENT EMERGENCY SITUATION During the latter half of May, there were an estimated 2,100 IDPs, of which 100 were living in a camp. By the middle of July the numbers had increased to over 8,000 IDPs, of which 1,300 were in Chico Guerreiro camp just outside of Nzaji. Daily, the numbers increase as people flee the fighting further south. It is felt that the longer the emergency exists, that fewer families and relatives will be able to support IDPs, and hence, these persons will be soon moving to the Chico Guerreiro camp, thereby rapidly swelling its numbers. It is estimated that in Nzaji alone, there will be over 30,000 IDPs by the end of August. These people are in need of basic health and sanitation facilities, shelter, blankets, basic household items, potable water, and food rations. As stated, there is a continuing movement of people from the communities further south to the town of Nzaji. In areas further south of Nzaji, nearer the front lines, there are pockets of IDPs such as in Mbuia. There are reports of other groups, but these have not been seen or confirmed by outside observers. However, there are many towns in the area, such as Mbuia, Cossa, Maludi, and Luia. Estimations are that there could be upwards of 30,000 people either on the road to Nzaji or in hiding, as the previously cited towns, with an average population of 3,000 to 5,000 each, are mostly deserted. The current assessment of these population is that they are in dire need of medical and food assistance, as well as proper water, sanitation, shelter facilities, and household items. III. TARGETED EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE LWF/WS-Angola, along with other agencies, will need to continue providing relief assistance to these displaced populations, seek to assist them back to their home communities when it is safe to do so, and help them to reintegrate and regain their productive capacity. LWF/WS-Angola does not want to create a permanent camp situation for IDPs; rather, it will focus, apart from ACT emergency relief activities, on how to assist people to return to their home communities and resettle there after the travails of the recent military incidents. LWF/WS-Angola will , during all phases, plan together with local residents, local authorities, UCAH (the coordinating agency of the United Nations in Angola) and the IDPs on issues concerning project implementation and activities affecting the welfare of all groups. These, along with various local groups, such as the churches, will also be utilized as much as possible in the actual implementation of the relief activities. Specific activities will include: Nzaji camp and other IDPs in Nzaji Registration and camp management: ACT/LWF needs to continue registering the displaced, along with MINARS. Proper recording of the displaced, and other relevant data are needed to effectively manage the situation and to assure that the correct amounts of needed relief supplies and other assistance are properly targeted to the needy populations. ACT/LWF will continue to work with MINARS staff to increase their capacity to perform this important task. Proper camp management has to continue, due to the ever increasing case load, to effectively channel and distribute assistance, and to assure that any new need that may arise is properly taken care of. Shelter: approximately 1000 family tents will be needed, or an equivalent amount of plastic sheeting. The IDPs have been presently constructing their own shelters in the camps, using local materials. This is supportable for a small camp population, but as the numbers increase, pressure on the surrounding environment will result in the denudation of adjacent areas, bringing IDPs into direct confrontation with residents, as they see their lands being stripped of building and firewood, and their fields trampled. As well, the adjacent areas are diamond mining areas, and it is imperative to avoid confrontations between the diamond miners (individuals and companies) and the displaced. UNICEF will contribute plastic sheeting for shelter and latrine construction. Sanitation: there is a need for at least 200 pit latrines. Plastic sheeting and covers will be needed, as well as digging tools and lime. Drainage ditches (in case of rain) will need to be dug around the shelter areas. Water: at least 100,000 litres of clean water will need to be made available daily (to a camp population of 5,000), to satisfy drinking, washing and other requirements. A lack of sufficient quantities of safe water will increase the chances of water borne diseases (such as cholera) in the camp. Materials and equipment needed are water bladders, distribution systems, and diesel pumps. UNICEF will contribute water storage and distribution equipment for the camp near Nzaji town. Non-food item distribution: buckets, blankets, cooking sets, axes, and machetes will be needed for the IDPs in the camp, as well as for those staying with relatives. UNICEF will contribute some household items, and high energy biscuits. Food assistance: the World Food program has been, and will continue to assure basic food rations for these populations, both in the camps, and in the town. Basic health: LWF/WS-Angola has already provided a hospital tent, and the services of one of its project nurses. It is availing itself of medicines from both UNICEF and the Red Cross, in giving primary medical care to patients in the camp. It is assumed that MSF-Holland will be taking over the health activities inside the camp (and in other areas where this type of assistance is needed ) as soon as possible. UNICEF will organize and implement a vaccination campaign in conjunction with the Ministry of Health and with ACT/LWF support. Logistics capacity : this is needed to adequately off-load, store, transport and record relief materials and equipment. At least one 8MT to 10MT heavy duty truck will be needed to off-load cargo planes, and to transport materials, equipment, and people from storage areas to distribution areas (non-food items, water equipment, building materials and building teams). LWF/WS-Angola’s 5MT Isuzu truck is not sufficient for the current and future workload. In addition the LWF/WS one Mitsubishi pick up is not sufficient to cover all operational needs. There is an additional need for one 4 WD light vehicle (pick-up with HF radio capacity) will be needed for day to day management and implementation operations, especially in the water sector. About 400 cubic meters of storage space is available in Nzaji town, and is being used by LWF/WS-Angola. Should more storage space be required outside of Nzaji, one or two Rubb Hall tents must be procured. Assistance to vulnerable groups: ACT/LWF - Angola will continue to look after the needs of these groups such as orphans, the elderly, the handicapped, widows with families. Outlying areas In the current situation, safe areas will need to be set up by the authorities with the attendant necessities of food, shelter, water, sanitation, and basic health care. These zones are between 30 and 70 kilometers from Nzaji town. For example, in Mbuia, the nearest safe water source is 18 kilometers away. This will require a tanking operation (with transport, bladders, and distribution systems) to satisfy the requirements of the displaced (and resident) populations nearby. It is estimated that around 15,000 people may be in need of assistance in these outlying zones. The same types of activities described above for the Njazi area will be required, with the same agency/partner roles. However, due to the less concentrated nature of the IDPs, more logistics support will be needed (transport and radio communications for instance), in order to reach all needy populations. Non ACT Appeal - Return and reintegration into home communities Along with relief activities, this has been one of LWF/WS-Angola’s principal activities in Angola, especially in the provinces of Lunda Norte, Lunda Sul, and Moxico. The basic principle is to assist the IDPs to return home when it is safe to do so and help them re-establish their lives and sustainable means of livelihood. This is done in partnership with the communities themselves, as they need to have a stake in any activities directed towards their resettlement and reintegration. The government should be helping with transport means for the returning displaced. Specific activities include: Agriculture: LWF will provide a first time seeds and tool kits, as well as horticultural seeds. In the interim, while awaiting the harvest, food assistance (in the form of seed protection food) should be provided by WFP. LWF will also provide agricultural extension assistance, using local staff who know the communities and speak the vernacular. Social infrastructure and shelter: LWF and the communities will rehabilitate or rebuild vital social infrastructure (schools, health posts, bridges etc), so that the community can become viable again. The communities will be encouraged to rebuild their own houses, but LWF can assist with some tools and other needed materials. Sanitation: LWF, along with village committees, will promote sanitation as a prerequisite of rebuilding a village. To this end, training and seminars will be done with the villagers, and they will be assisted in the planning and construction of latrines for their dwellings and for schools and health posts. Water: LWF will provide a water engineer and some materials to assist the villagers to rehabilitate their water sources of potable water. In the meantime, temporary water storage, with pumps if needed, will be provided until the villagers have completed these works. Education on the use and treatment of water and the management of water supplies and systems will be provided to the communities. Health: LWF will assist in the rehabilitation of health posts, the supply of basic medicines, and the training of the communities on how to manage the health posts and medical stocks. It is expected that a specialized medical agency, such as MSF-Holland and the Ministry of health will help to initially establish these posts and assure that they run properly before eventual handover to the communities IV. EMERGENCY PROJECT NEEDS Emergency relief for 30,000 IDPs (15,000 in and around Nzaji town; 15,000 people in out lying areas) over a six month period are included in the attached budget. ACT/LWF-Angola relief operations will need an experienced team to supplement the current staff in Nzaji, who will continue implementing other non-appeal programming bilaterally funded by other donors. Sector specialists are identified as needed. Transport, communications and supervisory equipment and materials are allowed for. Administrative, operational and support costs are identified, which are required in order to support overall project management costs. Materials and equipment are provided for each sector, although health will be mostly left to the health agency (MSF-Holland and UNICEF). It is assumed that most labor from the communities will be compensated for through a ‘Food For Work’ program with WFP. If FFW is provided directly to the IDPs, coordinating mechanisms will be established to insure maximum impact, to eliminate the potential for provision of double rations, and to prevent flooding the local market with free food. V. BUDGET NARRATIVE and COMMENTS The total project budget for the emergency relief assistance is $1,309,800. A portion of this total project budget will be provided in cash or in kind from the LWF/WS-Angola annual Statement of Needs budget, support from WFP for cargo flights, and support from UNICEF. The total target for the ACT appeal is: $1,070,600 From this appeal target, the following commitments have been pledged: 1. DanChurchAid 150 Rolls of reinforced plastic 2. Diakonisches Werk 600 Family Tents In addition, DanChurchAid has indicated that they will advocate for DANIDA back donor funds to support the ACT appeal assistance. Further investigation is ongoing regarding other potential back donor funding. Please note that almost all of the Emergency Relief & Assistance commodities contained within the project and appeal budget may be provided ‘In-Kind’ by ACT donors whenever available. In compliance with ACT policy, all In-Kind donations of relief materials from northern ACT members must include transport costs to Angola. In Kind material donations could greatly reduce the level of cash funding needed for ACT appeal assistance. However, in the absence of ‘In-Kind’ support, funding will be required for procurement and transport of relief materials.

Heavy military activities in many areas continue to be reported. The situation in the rest of Angola remains tense, with reports of both government and UNITA efforts to recruit new soldiers and reports of new supplies of arms and weapons being received by both sides. As a result of the conflict in the Lunde Norte region, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of internally displaced people (primarily women & children) fleeing the conflict zones. The total estimated number of displaced people is 30,000 at the present time. There are over 8,000 displaced persons in Nzaji town, 1,500 in the Chico Guerrero camp outside of town, and many others in the towns surrounding Nzaji. ACT member, Lutheran World Service- Angola Program (ACT/LWS) has appealed for emergency assistance for these displaced families in northeastern Angola. Targeted assistance will include the provision of tents, water, clothing, non food items, shelter materials, food and basic health requirements during a 6 month period. All appeal activities will be implemented through the established ACT/LWS Angola program and offices working in cooperation with local churches, communities and authorities, as well as in conjunction with international organizations and NGOs. We request your prompt and generous support to this vital ACT emergency relief effort to assist the families of Angola displaced by war and conflict. We thank you in advance for your support.

EMERGENCY BACKGROUND INFORMATION The recent military events ,and subsequent flight of IDPs in the Nzaji (Andrade) area of Lunda Norte province started a month after the investiture of the Government of national Unity (GURN) in Angola. Since that time there has been a constant influx of internally displaced people (IDPs) into the Nzaji area. According to UN sources, tensions are high in areas recently taken by government forces from UNITA. Hundreds of people are still moving north to Nzaji to escape the fighting in their villages. As of mid-July over 8,000 IDPs had been registered in Nzaji town, with over 1,300 staying the IDP camp just outside of town. LWF/WS-Angola began working in Lunda Norte in early 1994, with the support of Church Action Angola (CAA), a consortium of European and Angolan churches. The Angolan government, via the Ministry of Social Reintegration (MINARS) approached LWF/WS-Angola to provide post-war relief assistance in the area. Following a needs assessment with the local communities and local authorities, LWF/WS began to distribute food (provided by WFP and other donors) and non-food items (provided mostly by the LWF system), out of its base in Dundo, to the affected population- which included over 50,000 displaced people. Operations were extended to Nzaji in September 1995, also to provide relief assistance to displaced populations there. Since that time, LWF/WS-Angola has gradually transformed its programme from strictly relief to one oriented towards rehabilitation and assisting people to return and reintegrate to their home community. This is being accomplished through projects geared to promote and improve livelihood, security and self sufficiency such as agriculture, repair of social infrastructure, community health and sanitation, skills training, and assistance to vulnerable groups. Throughout all projects, LWF/WS-Angola maintains its working relationship through its primary partners which are the communities themselves, local churches and the local authorities. The programme and the projects reflect the theme that the best solution in emergency and relief situations is to assist people to return and resettle back to their home communities as soon as it is feasible, and to strengthen the communities’ capacity to regain their livelihood and dignity. LWF/WS-Angola has been able to build up good relations with the local communities, churches, and authorities (with the government and UNITA). In this manner, assistance has been able to reach those most in need, in both government and UNITA controlled areas. With the recent IDP situation in Nzaji, LWF/WS-Angola has been able to immediately provide relief assistance to over 8,000 displaced in the Nzaji area from its Nzaji office. Using its staff and other resources, LWF/WS-Angola, with MINARS, has been able to register the IDPs and provide shelter, non-food items, basic health and logistics assistance to over 1,300 persons in the displaced camp at Chico Guerreiro. Food rations have been provided by WFP. LWF/WS-Angola has also been able to provide some logistics support to other agencies who have arrived in the area to support the relief efforts. II. CURRENT EMERGENCY SITUATION During the latter half of May, there were an estimated 2,100 IDPs, of which 100 were living in a camp. By the middle of July the numbers had increased to over 8,000 IDPs, of which 1,300 were in Chico Guerreiro camp just outside of Nzaji. Daily, the numbers increase as people flee the fighting further south. It is felt that the longer the emergency exists, that fewer families and relatives will be able to support IDPs, and hence, these persons will be soon moving to the Chico Guerreiro camp, thereby rapidly swelling its numbers. It is estimated that in Nzaji alone, there will be over 30,000 IDPs by the end of August. These people are in need of basic health and sanitation facilities, shelter, blankets, basic household items, potable water, and food rations. As stated, there is a continuing movement of people from the communities further south to the town of Nzaji. In areas further south of Nzaji, nearer the front lines, there are pockets of IDPs such as in Mbuia. There are reports of other groups, but these have not been seen or confirmed by outside observers. However, there are many towns in the area, such as Mbuia, Cossa, Maludi, and Luia. Estimations are that there could be upwards of 30,000 people either on the road to Nzaji or in hiding, as the previously cited towns, with an average population of 3,000 to 5,000 each, are mostly deserted. The current assessment of these population is that they are in dire need of medical and food assistance, as well as proper water, sanitation, shelter facilities, and household items. III. TARGETED EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE LWF/WS-Angola, along with other agencies, will need to continue providing relief assistance to these displaced populations, seek to assist them back to their home communities when it is safe to do so, and help them to reintegrate and regain their productive capacity. LWF/WS-Angola does not want to create a permanent camp situation for IDPs; rather, it will focus, apart from ACT emergency relief activities, on how to assist people to return to their home communities and resettle there after the travails of the recent military incidents. LWF/WS-Angola will , during all phases, plan together with local residents, local authorities, UCAH (the coordinating agency of the United Nations in Angola) and the IDPs on issues concerning project implementation and activities affecting the welfare of all groups. These, along with various local groups, such as the churches, will also be utilized as much as possible in the actual implementation of the relief activities. Specific activities will include: Nzaji camp and other IDPs in Nzaji Registration and camp management: ACT/LWF needs to continue registering the displaced, along with MINARS. Proper recording of the displaced, and other relevant data are needed to effectively manage the situation and to assure that the correct amounts of needed relief supplies and other assistance are properly targeted to the needy populations. ACT/LWF will continue to work with MINARS staff to increase their capacity to perform this important task. Proper camp management has to continue, due to the ever increasing case load, to effectively channel and distribute assistance, and to assure that any new need that may arise is properly taken care of. Shelter: approximately 1000 family tents will be needed, or an equivalent amount of plastic sheeting. The IDPs have been presently constructing their own shelters in the camps, using local materials. This is supportable for a small camp population, but as the numbers increase, pressure on the surrounding environment will result in the denudation of adjacent areas, bringing IDPs into direct confrontation with residents, as they see their lands being stripped of building and firewood, and their fields trampled. As well, the adjacent areas are diamond mining areas, and it is imperative to avoid confrontations between the diamond miners (individuals and companies) and the displaced. UNICEF will contribute plastic sheeting for shelter and latrine construction. Sanitation: there is a need for at least 200 pit latrines. Plastic sheeting and covers will be needed, as well as digging tools and lime. Drainage ditches (in case of rain) will need to be dug around the shelter areas. Water: at least 100,000 litres of clean water will need to be made available daily (to a camp population of 5,000), to satisfy drinking, washing and other requirements. A lack of sufficient quantities of safe water will increase the chances of water borne diseases (such as cholera) in the camp. Materials and equipment needed are water bladders, distribution systems, and diesel pumps. UNICEF will contribute water storage and distribution equipment for the camp near Nzaji town. Non-food item distribution: buckets, blankets, cooking sets, axes, and machetes will be needed for the IDPs in the camp, as well as for those staying with relatives. UNICEF will contribute some household items, and high energy biscuits. Food assistance: the World Food program has been, and will continue to assure basic food rations for these populations, both in the camps, and in the town. Basic health: LWF/WS-Angola has already provided a hospital tent, and the services of one of its project nurses. It is availing itself of medicines from both UNICEF and the Red Cross, in giving primary medical care to patients in the camp. It is assumed that MSF-Holland will be taking over the health activities inside the camp (and in other areas where this type of assistance is needed ) as soon as possible. UNICEF will organize and implement a vaccination campaign in conjunction with the Ministry of Health and with ACT/LWF support. Logistics capacity : this is needed to adequately off-load, store, transport and record relief materials and equipment. At least one 8MT to 10MT heavy duty truck will be needed to off-load cargo planes, and to transport materials, equipment, and people from storage areas to distribution areas (non-food items, water equipment, building materials and building teams). LWF/WS-Angola’s 5MT Isuzu truck is not sufficient for the current and future workload. In addition the LWF/WS one Mitsubishi pick up is not sufficient to cover all operational needs. There is an additional need for one 4 WD light vehicle (pick-up with HF radio capacity) will be needed for day to day management and implementation operations, especially in the water sector. About 400 cubic meters of storage space is available in Nzaji town, and is being used by LWF/WS-Angola. Should more storage space be required outside of Nzaji, one or two Rubb Hall tents must be procured. Assistance to vulnerable groups: ACT/LWF - Angola will continue to look after the needs of these groups such as orphans, the elderly, the handicapped, widows with families. Outlying areas In the current situation, safe areas will need to be set up by the authorities with the attendant necessities of food, shelter, water, sanitation, and basic health care. These zones are between 30 and 70 kilometers from Nzaji town. For example, in Mbuia, the nearest safe water source is 18 kilometers away. This will require a tanking operation (with transport, bladders, and distribution systems) to satisfy the requirements of the displaced (and resident) populations nearby. It is estimated that around 15,000 people may be in need of assistance in these outlying zones. The same types of activities described above for the Njazi area will be required, with the same agency/partner roles. However, due to the less concentrated nature of the IDPs, more logistics support will be needed (transport and radio communications for instance), in order to reach all needy populations. Non ACT Appeal - Return and reintegration into home communities Along with relief activities, this has been one of LWF/WS-Angola’s principal activities in Angola, especially in the provinces of Lunda Norte, Lunda Sul, and Moxico. The basic principle is to assist the IDPs to return home when it is safe to do so and help them re-establish their lives and sustainable means of livelihood. This is done in partnership with the communities themselves, as they need to have a stake in any activities directed towards their resettlement and reintegration. The government should be helping with transport means for the returning displaced. Specific activities include: Agriculture: LWF will provide a first time seeds and tool kits, as well as horticultural seeds. In the interim, while awaiting the harvest, food assistance (in the form of seed protection food) should be provided by WFP. LWF will also provide agricultural extension assistance, using local staff who know the communities and speak the vernacular. Social infrastructure and shelter: LWF and the communities will rehabilitate or rebuild vital social infrastructure (schools, health posts, bridges etc), so that the community can become viable again. The communities will be encouraged to rebuild their own houses, but LWF can assist with some tools and other needed materials. Sanitation: LWF, along with village committees, will promote sanitation as a prerequisite of rebuilding a village. To this end, training and seminars will be done with the villagers, and they will be assisted in the planning and construction of latrines for their dwellings and for schools and health posts. Water: LWF will provide a water engineer and some materials to assist the villagers to rehabilitate their water sources of potable water. In the meantime, temporary water storage, with pumps if needed, will be provided until the villagers have completed these works. Education on the use and treatment of water and the management of water supplies and systems will be provided to the communities. Health: LWF will assist in the rehabilitation of health posts, the supply of basic medicines, and the training of the communities on how to manage the health posts and medical stocks. It is expected that a specialized medical agency, such as MSF-Holland and the Ministry of health will help to initially establish these posts and assure that they run properly before eventual handover to the communities IV. EMERGENCY PROJECT NEEDS Emergency relief for 30,000 IDPs (15,000 in and around Nzaji town; 15,000 people in out lying areas) over a six month period are included in the attached budget. ACT/LWF-Angola relief operations will need an experienced team to supplement the current staff in Nzaji, who will continue implementing other non-appeal programming bilaterally funded by other donors. Sector specialists are identified as needed. Transport, communications and supervisory equipment and materials are allowed for. Administrative, operational and support costs are identified, which are required in order to support overall project management costs. Materials and equipment are provided for each sector, although health will be mostly left to the health agency (MSF-Holland and UNICEF). It is assumed that most labor from the communities will be compensated for through a ‘Food For Work’ program with WFP. If FFW is provided directly to the IDPs, coordinating mechanisms will be established to insure maximum impact, to eliminate the potential for provision of double rations, and to prevent flooding the local market with free food. V. BUDGET NARRATIVE and COMMENTS The total project budget for the emergency relief assistance is $1,309,800. A portion of this total project budget will be provided in cash or in kind from the LWF/WS-Angola annual Statement of Needs budget, support from WFP for cargo flights, and support from UNICEF. The total target for the ACT appeal is: $1,070,600 From this appeal target, the following commitments have been pledged: 1. DanChurchAid 150 Rolls of reinforced plastic 2. Diakonisches Werk 600 Family Tents In addition, DanChurchAid has indicated that they will advocate for DANIDA back donor funds to support the ACT appeal assistance. Further investigation is ongoing regarding other potential back donor funding. Please note that almost all of the Emergency Relief & Assistance commodities contained within the project and appeal budget may be provided ‘In-Kind’ by ACT donors whenever available. In compliance with ACT policy, all In-Kind donations of relief materials from northern ACT members must include transport costs to Angola. In Kind material donations could greatly reduce the level of cash funding needed for ACT appeal assistance. However, in the absence of ‘In-Kind’ support, funding will be required for procurement and transport of relief materials.

135,32410,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Sudan Complex Emergency Situation Report #2,"U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BUREAU FOR HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE (BHR) OFFICE OF U.S. FOREIGN DISASTER ASSISTANCE (OFDA) SUDAN - Complex Emergency Situation Report #2, Fiscal Year (FY) 1997-- September 2, 1997 Note: The last situation report was dated November 12, 1996. BACKGROUND  Fighting began in 1983 between the Government of Sudan (GOS) and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) when the southern-based rebels demanded more influence in the government and protested the GOS efforts to ""Islamize"" the Christian and animist south. In 1991, the SPLA split into factions, and intensified fighting between SPLA factions erupted in areas of the south. The conflict continues today and civilians throughout the south and the transitional zone (the area of southern Darfur, southern Kordofan, northern Bahr el Ghazal, and the northern Upper Nile States) are directly affected by aerial bombings by the GOS and forced relocations due to fighting. Ongoing insecurity and population displacement in the south and the transitional zone have not only interrupted or destroyed most of the indigenous trading and productive systems, but have also been a major impediment to relief efforts. The United Nations (U.N.) and numerous non-governmental organizations (NGO) within and outside the framework  of Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) are delivering relief assistance by airlifts, airdrops, barges, trains, and truck convoys. In the more secure areas of southern Sudan, efforts to rehabilitate and restore self-sufficiency are underway. NUMBERS AFFECTED AT A GLANCE Figures listed are U.N. Humanitarian Coordination Unit and U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates. Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs): 2.5 million, including 1.8 million in Khartoum, 350,000 in the transition zone and government-held garrison towns, 150,000 in camps in Equatoria, and additional tens of thousands elsewhere.  Refugees: 209,000 Sudanese refugees in Uganda, 110,000 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), 78,000 in Ethiopia, 28,000 in Kenya and 27,000 in the Central African Republic. 349,000 Eritreans, 51,000 Ethiopians, 4,400 Chadians, and 10,000 refugees of various origins currently in Sudan.   Total USAID Assistance for FY 1997 (to date) $39,774,378 CURRENT SITUATION Thousands Displaced as Rebels Advance: In January, the united forces of the SPLA and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), an alliance of opposition groups in northern and southern Sudan formed last October, launched a military campaign in the northern regions of Sudan. The military campaign, aimed at toppling the Sudanese government, initially resulted in the capture of several strategic areas. The offensive slowed down after a government call for general mobilization, but NDA forces still reportedly control several towns in the Red Sea and Blue Nile regions, including Kurmuk, Qeissan, and Maban. The NDA, based in Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, includes the country's main traditional parties and the SPLA. In March, the military offensive shifted to the far south after SPLA forces captured the town of Yei. The SPLA subsequently seized Kaya and Kajo Keji in Western Equatoria and Rumbek in Bahr el Ghazal/Lakes. The SPLA, under the leadership of John Garang, now controls most of Western  Equatoria and Bahr el Ghazal/Lakes. The renewed military offensive generated major population movements, particularly in the south.  A joint OLS assessment in late March identified a total of 100,000 returning refugees from northern Uganda and vulnerable persons among the resident population in Yei as requiring urgent relief food and non-food assistance. Many returnees eventually settled in or around their home villages, while others settled in three existing IDP camps located near Uganda. The mass exodus into southern Sudan coincided with increased rebel activity in northern Uganda.  Restrictions Hamper Response: GOS-imposed restrictions on relief operations hindered initial efforts to meet humanitarian needs from April to June. In both May and June, the GOS suspended all flights into southern Sudan for up to one week. From March to June, the GOS also banned all C-130 flights to Equatoria and Bahr el Ghazal from Lokichokio, the OLS base in northern Kenya, and the use of high capacity C-130 Hercules aircraft in areas controlled by the SPLA. OLS access improved in July following the visit of the newly-appointed U.N. Special Envoy for Humanitarian Affairs for the Sudan Ambassador Robert Van Schaik. However, reports indicate that the restrictions on OLS flights reduced food aid for more than 700,000 aid-dependent Sudanese and prevented the delivery of seeds and tools, affecting timely planting.  Minor restrictions imposed by the SPLA also affected humanitarian access to some areas.  Recent SPLA gains have, however, allowed the OLS to transport relief supplies and personnel to Western Equatoria and Lakes regions by road via Uganda for the first time in many years.  OLS Ground Rules Violations: In July, the United States temporarily suspended all distribution of vegetable oil in southern Sudan, northern Uganda, and northern Kenya. The suspension was imposed after an estimated 300 MT of BHR/Office of Food for Peace (FFP)-provided P.L.480 Title II commodities were diverted by SPLA officers and sold for personal gain in northern Uganda in early May, in violation of OLS ground agreements. The suspension was lifted in late August following a field investigation by a team from BHR/FFP and the USAID Office of the Inspector General's Special Audit Division that took place from July 21 to August 4. In discussions with the team, the SPLA's humanitarian wing, Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Association (SRRA), confirmed the diversions took place but without SRRA/SPLA sanction. The team has recommended several specific measures to reduce the potential for future diversions.  Donors and NGOs are also concerned about recent violations of OLS ground rules committed by SPLA forces in Western Equatoria, including the commandeering and use of NGO vehicles for military purposes. In late July, armed bandits forcibly entered the World Vision Relief and Development (WVRD) compound in Yambio, Western Equatoria, and robbed, beat, and held at gunpoint five international staff while SPLA military were nearby. All WVRD staff were subsequently evacuated. Some items looted have been recovered and four people were reportedly arrested later in connection with the attack. In late January, SPLA forces entered a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)/France compound in Pochalla, forced the staff into a tent, and looted equipment. The staff were safely evacuated to Lokichokio, and U.N. World Food Program (WFP) and MSF/France equipment looted during this attack were later recovered.  In July, Southern Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM) faction forces looted radios and other property from an NGO compound in Ayod, Upper Nile Province, also in violation of OLS ground rules agreement. SSIM forces also occupied health units and looted medicines from a BHR/OFDA-funded Mercy Corps International (MCI)/ACROSS health project in Akobo. While activities under this project continue in other areas, the Akobo portion was suspended. 1996/97 Crop Outcome: According to a USAID Famine Early Warning System bulletin released in late July, a dry spell that affected parts of southern Sudan in May and June will severely affect crop yields in Rumbek and Yirol in Bahr el Ghazal/Lakes and Juba, Torit, and Kapoeta counties in Equatoria in the coming weeks. Although pasture and herd conditions are generally good, NGOs estimate that the dry spell, which also rendered crops more susceptible to damage from insect pests and disease, will reduce first-crop harvests for about 300,000 persons by as much as 65%. Prospects for the second, main-season crop, which represents 60-75% of annual production, depend on the current rains, which arrived late at the end of June and will last until October. Outstanding OLS relief food requirements for 1997 are currently projected at 36,410 MT.  POLITICAL/MILITARY SITUATION GOS Signs Peace Agreement with Rebel Groups: On April 22, the GOS and five rebel factions, including the SSIM and the SPLA/Bahr el Ghazal Group, signed a peace agreement in Khartoum. Under the peace deal, a coordinating council would run the affairs of southern Sudan for four years after which a referendum on the future status of southern Sudan would be held.  Soon after, six factions, including all five signatories to the peace agreement, signed an accord recognizing former Garang ally and SSIM leader Riek Machar as their overall and united militarily under the South Sudan Defense Force. The United States commended the peace agreement as a positive first step, but stressed the need for the GOS to seek a peaceful settlement with other factions.  IGAD Peace Negotiations: From July 8 to 9, President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya hosted a regional summit of Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) members to discuss the war in southern Sudan and Somalia. The GOS, after some initial resistance, finally accepted a declaration of principles as a basis for discussion, clearing the way for the resumption of talks which broke off nearly three years ago. The principles lay the groundwork for discussions regarding the country's return to a secular constitution and a four-year interim administration to address issues surrounding self-determination. Al Bashir also called for a cease- fire with the SPLA during an official visit to South Africa. Both the SPLA and NDA rejected the call for a cease-fire, arguing that it was just a ploy to give the GOS an opportunity to rebuild its forces against advancing SPLA troops. In late August, South African President Nelson Mandela held separate talks with al Bashir and Garang and hosted a summit between al Bashir and Ugandan President Yoweri Musevini. A meeting of East African leaders under the auspices of IGAD, which was originally scheduled for August 19, has been indefinitely postponed. USG Increases Involvement: The United States has stepped up diplomatic efforts to pressure the GOS and other parties to improve the country's poor human rights record and cease hostilities. At the USG's urging, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights is pressuring the GOS to comply with international human rights laws and reduce restrictions on international relief organizations. The USG also backed a recent U.N. Security Council (UNSC) Resolution banning international flights by aircraft owned, leased, or controlled by the already-bankrupt Sudan Airways or another entity of the GOS. Other UNSC sanctions on Sudan restrict international travel for GOS officials and call on nations to reduce the size of Sudanese diplomatic missions abroad and to not hold international conferences in Sudan.  RELIEF EFFORTS IDPs and Returnees Assisted: Coordinated donor- funded relief efforts continue to focus on the highly- variable needs of returnees from Uganda, as well as those displaced by this year's offensive. OLS delivered food and priority relief supplies by road from Yambio and from WFP food stores in Uganda and BHR/OFDA-funded NGOs have been active in the distribution of agricultural inputs and relief kits, health activities, and the rehabilitation of key road routes.  WFP recently initiated an airlift operation into Juba where over 20,000 returnees, most of whom had arrived from Yei, required immediate assistance. WFP barge convoys will deliver nearly 4,000 MT of food and non-food supplies to Juba by the end of September. Nutritional activities, implemented through the BHR/OFDA-funded Action contre la Faim (ACF) grant, also continue.  Three WFP barge convoys successfully delivered over 2,400 MT of food to beneficiaries along the Nile River corridor, despite the looting and attack of one barge convoy in Jonglei reportedly  carried out by SSIM forces. Relief agencies are also responding to rising humanitarian needs among displaced populations in Bahr el Ghazal/Lakes Region. In Khartoum, donors and relief organizations are working with the GOS to ensure that needs continue to be met, despite the demolition and relocation of several IDP camps in the area.  BHR/OFDA and BHR/FFP programs continue to provide food, water, and health care for IDPs in Greater Khartoum. Access to IDPs in and around Khartoum has improved, allowing several therapeutic and supplementary feeding centers to address high levels of wasting.  BHR/OFDA is also funding Save the Children Fund (SC)/US food security and health activities that benefit populations in areas of south Kordofan under GOS control and is funding a small water project through Norwegian People's Aid (NPA), implemented by the Nuba Relief, Rehabilitation, and Development Society (NRRDS) to provide water assistance in areas outside GOS control. SC/US is trying to secure an agreement from the GOS and SPLA to conduct measles vaccinations in rebel-controlled areas. Parts of northern and western Sudan, including Darfur, recently experienced heavy flooding. Casualty figures and details on the full extent of the flooding are unavailable.  In the Red Sea Hills Region, the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC), the Sudanese Red Crescent Society (SRCS), and Oxfam are working to provide food to thousands of drought-stricken Beja nomads, despite numerous logistical and security problems. Oxfam and SRCS also provided supplementary feeding to vulnerable groups in Tokar and Sinkat provinces in response to reports of high levels of wasting and malnutrition in this area. Also, IDPs and war-affected people remain vulnerable and in need of assistance in areas of the Blue Nile that fell under NDA control in January. WFP recently delivered food to four IDP camps in the region.  Disease Outbreaks: Surveys conducted by CARE, International Medical Corps (IMC), and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control have revealed an outbreak of sleeping sickness in Western Equatoria. The team found an overall 19.3% prevalence of the disease in Tambura County, with Ezo town, the epicenter of the disease, reporting a very high 27% prevalence rate. IMC and CARE hope to respond to the outbreak, among the worst documented in this century. Sleeping sickness is a parasitical vector-borne disease that is fatal if untreated. Relapsing fever has also been reported in Mankien, Upper Nile, among new IDPs from Gogrial. Efforts to treat existing cases and control an outbreak of this vector-borne disease, which could cause death if left untreated, are currently underway. An outbreak of relapsing fever recently reported in Twic County is said to be under control and treatment is ongoing. OLS NGOs recently conducted several measles vaccination campaigns following reported cases near Juba, Yei, and Bahr el Jebel, as well as in western Upper Nile and northern Bahr el Ghazal. An outbreak of  gastrointenstitis and cholera reported in Eastern Equatoria is now under control. OLS also conducted vaccinations against rinderpest in Bahr el Ghazal and anthrax in Eastern Equatoria.  OLS Funding Crisis: Despite urgent humanitarian needs, the U.N. scaled back activities, particularly air operations, in southern Sudan for several weeks when funding received for the 1997 U.N. Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for Sudan fell short of the amount requested. The Appeal, which was launched on February 18, requested $120.8 million for 33 projects, of which 29 are OLS projects, in six priority areas. Priority activities supported by the Appeal include emergency food aid and essential health, nutritional, and water activities, as well as overall logistics support, Lokichokio camp management, and security. OLS is conducting a large fund-raising effort and has established a cost-recovery system for air operations and for food and lodging at the Lokichokio base camp. BHR/OFDA has already contributed $2.25 million to UNICEF and $1.3 million to WFP to support OLS operations.  OLS Donors' Meeting: OLS's recent funding difficulties, humanitarian conditions, and access difficulties were the highlights of the U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs' Second International Advisory Committee (IAC) meeting on OLS held in Geneva on June 27. Senior U.N. representatives and donor government representatives, including BHR/OFDA, attended.  The IAC invoked the 1994 OLS Agreements facilitated by IGAD as providing a framework within which OLS should pursue its activities in cooperation with the GOS and the rebel movements rather than trying to negotiate a new access agreement in Sudan. Participants also discussed the status of 1997 OLS programs as well as progress achieved in efforts to reform OLS. After the meeting, Ambassador Van Schaik sent a letter to the GOS requesting action and clarification on access and clearance issues.  Before attending the Geneva meeting, Ambassador Van Schaik traveled to Sudan, Lokichokio, and Nairobi to discuss humanitarian access issues with OLS and representatives from the GOS and SPLA. Ambassador Van Schaik, former Permanent Representative of the Netherlands to the U.N., succeeds Ambassador Vieri Traxler, who resigned last September on account of ill health. ICRC Suspension Continues: ICRC suspended its operations in Sudan following the hijacking of an ICRC plane in November. The aircraft was captured by forces of GOS-ally Kerubino Kwanyin Bol upon landing in Wunrok in Bahr el Ghazal to return five wounded SPLA soldiers.  Four westerners who were on board, including an American pilot, were released  after 38 days, following the intervention of former New Mexico Congressman Bill Richardson, now U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. However, the welfare of the five Sudanese who remain in captivity is unknown. Nine ICRC staff in Juba, held under house arrest since November 1, when this incident began, were released in December. ICRC activities will remain suspended until GOS accusations that the ICRC was transporting arms are put to rest. However, the ICRC hospital in Lokichokio is operating at full capacity and the ICRC continues to work with Sudanese prisoners in Uganda and Sudan. ICRC recently sent food to Juba hospital under the auspices of the SRCS. Later in March, an OLS aircraft was detained in Bor, Jonglei province, by GOS authorities claiming that flight clearance for the aircraft had not yet reached them. The GOS officials accused the pilot of carrying sensitive documents to rebels and held him for seven weeks until, following the intervention of senior U.N. officials, he was released on May 2. The documents in question reportedly were flight log books and aviation maps.  Refugees: In line with an agreement between Sudan, Ethiopia, and the UNHCR, the last 23,000 Ethiopian refugees in eastern Sudan are expected to be voluntarily repatriated this year.  Of this group, about 7,000 Ethiopians were repatriated between May and July. Effective May, Eritrea suspended UNHCR staff from Eritrea over disagreements about the repatriation of refugees from Sudan. UNHCR is currently investigating high mortality rates among IDPs and refugees in Juba, particularly among 800 or so refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo.  USG ASSISTANCE TO SUDAN The USG has actively been providing humanitarian assistance to Sudan since 1988. On October 28, 1996, U.S. Ambassador to Sudan, Timothy Carney, renewed the disaster declaration for Sudan for FY 1997, stating that continued U.S. assistance is required to assist over 3 million war-affected and displaced Sudanese. Currently, the USG's humanitarian response to the emergency in Sudan is provided through BHR/OFDA, BHR/FFP, and the State Department's Bureau for Population, Refugee, and Migration (PRM). USG- funded programs in Sudan promote continuing emergency relief to populations at risk, while at the same time providing rehabilitation assistance that builds local capacity to meet their own needs. This goal is captured under the recently-approved USG Integrated Strategy Plan for Sudan 1997-1999, which was developed within the context of the complex emergency in Sudan and takes into consideration current legislative restrictions on providing development aid to Sudan. The plan aims to meet urgent food needs in a way that increases food self- reliance and to address the major causes of mortality in Sudan by supporting comprehensive coverage by a basic primary health care network. It also promotes working with appropriate authorities and IDPs to develop local reintegration options and strengthening local capacities for peace as well as relationships and linkages that help reduce conflict. BHR/OFDA and BHR/FFP staff in Washington continue to work with the USAID/Regional Economic Development Services Offices/Sudan Field Office to plan and monitor relief and rehabilitation activities in southern Sudan and with USAID/Khartoum staff to monitor activities in northern Sudan and GOS- controlled areas of the south. In January 1996, the United States suspended its diplomatic presence in Khartoum, due to concerns for the safety of American Embassy personnel in Sudan. Subsequently, Ambassador Carney established a temporary office in Nairobi to maintain regular diplomatic communications with the GOS.

BACKGROUND  Fighting began in 1983 between the Government of Sudan (GOS) and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) when the southern-based rebels demanded more influence in the government and protested the GOS efforts to ""Islamize"" the Christian and animist south. In 1991, the SPLA split into factions, and intensified fighting between SPLA factions erupted in areas of the south. The conflict continues today and civilians throughout the south and the transitional zone (the area of southern Darfur, southern Kordofan, northern Bahr el Ghazal, and the northern Upper Nile States) are directly affected by aerial bombings by the GOS and forced relocations due to fighting. Ongoing insecurity and population displacement in the south and the transitional zone have not only interrupted or destroyed most of the indigenous trading and productive systems, but have also been a major impediment to relief efforts. The United Nations (U.N.) and numerous non-governmental organizations (NGO) within and outside the framework  of Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) are delivering relief assistance by airlifts, airdrops, barges, trains, and truck convoys. In the more secure areas of southern Sudan, efforts to rehabilitate and restore self-sufficiency are underway. NUMBERS AFFECTED AT A GLANCE Figures listed are U.N. Humanitarian Coordination Unit and U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates. Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs): 2.5 million, including 1.8 million in Khartoum, 350,000 in the transition zone and government-held garrison towns, 150,000 in camps in Equatoria, and additional tens of thousands elsewhere.  Refugees: 209,000 Sudanese refugees in Uganda, 110,000 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), 78,000 in Ethiopia, 28,000 in Kenya and 27,000 in the Central African Republic. 349,000 Eritreans, 51,000 Ethiopians, 4,400 Chadians, and 10,000 refugees of various origins currently in Sudan.   Total USAID Assistance for FY 1997 (to date) $39,774,378 CURRENT SITUATION Thousands Displaced as Rebels Advance: In January, the united forces of the SPLA and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), an alliance of opposition groups in northern and southern Sudan formed last October, launched a military campaign in the northern regions of Sudan. The military campaign, aimed at toppling the Sudanese government, initially resulted in the capture of several strategic areas. The offensive slowed down after a government call for general mobilization, but NDA forces still reportedly control several towns in the Red Sea and Blue Nile regions, including Kurmuk, Qeissan, and Maban. The NDA, based in Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, includes the country's main traditional parties and the SPLA. In March, the military offensive shifted to the far south after SPLA forces captured the town of Yei. The SPLA subsequently seized Kaya and Kajo Keji in Western Equatoria and Rumbek in Bahr el Ghazal/Lakes. The SPLA, under the leadership of John Garang, now controls most of Western  Equatoria and Bahr el Ghazal/Lakes. The renewed military offensive generated major population movements, particularly in the south.  A joint OLS assessment in late March identified a total of 100,000 returning refugees from northern Uganda and vulnerable persons among the resident population in Yei as requiring urgent relief food and non-food assistance. Many returnees eventually settled in or around their home villages, while others settled in three existing IDP camps located near Uganda. The mass exodus into southern Sudan coincided with increased rebel activity in northern Uganda.  Restrictions Hamper Response: GOS-imposed restrictions on relief operations hindered initial efforts to meet humanitarian needs from April to June. In both May and June, the GOS suspended all flights into southern Sudan for up to one week. From March to June, the GOS also banned all C-130 flights to Equatoria and Bahr el Ghazal from Lokichokio, the OLS base in northern Kenya, and the use of high capacity C-130 Hercules aircraft in areas controlled by the SPLA. OLS access improved in July following the visit of the newly-appointed U.N. Special Envoy for Humanitarian Affairs for the Sudan Ambassador Robert Van Schaik. However, reports indicate that the restrictions on OLS flights reduced food aid for more than 700,000 aid-dependent Sudanese and prevented the delivery of seeds and tools, affecting timely planting.  Minor restrictions imposed by the SPLA also affected humanitarian access to some areas.  Recent SPLA gains have, however, allowed the OLS to transport relief supplies and personnel to Western Equatoria and Lakes regions by road via Uganda for the first time in many years.  OLS Ground Rules Violations: In July, the United States temporarily suspended all distribution of vegetable oil in southern Sudan, northern Uganda, and northern Kenya. The suspension was imposed after an estimated 300 MT of BHR/Office of Food for Peace (FFP)-provided P.L.480 Title II commodities were diverted by SPLA officers and sold for personal gain in northern Uganda in early May, in violation of OLS ground agreements. The suspension was lifted in late August following a field investigation by a team from BHR/FFP and the USAID Office of the Inspector General's Special Audit Division that took place from July 21 to August 4. In discussions with the team, the SPLA's humanitarian wing, Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Association (SRRA), confirmed the diversions took place but without SRRA/SPLA sanction. The team has recommended several specific measures to reduce the potential for future diversions.  Donors and NGOs are also concerned about recent violations of OLS ground rules committed by SPLA forces in Western Equatoria, including the commandeering and use of NGO vehicles for military purposes. In late July, armed bandits forcibly entered the World Vision Relief and Development (WVRD) compound in Yambio, Western Equatoria, and robbed, beat, and held at gunpoint five international staff while SPLA military were nearby. All WVRD staff were subsequently evacuated. Some items looted have been recovered and four people were reportedly arrested later in connection with the attack. In late January, SPLA forces entered a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)/France compound in Pochalla, forced the staff into a tent, and looted equipment. The staff were safely evacuated to Lokichokio, and U.N. World Food Program (WFP) and MSF/France equipment looted during this attack were later recovered.  In July, Southern Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM) faction forces looted radios and other property from an NGO compound in Ayod, Upper Nile Province, also in violation of OLS ground rules agreement. SSIM forces also occupied health units and looted medicines from a BHR/OFDA-funded Mercy Corps International (MCI)/ACROSS health project in Akobo. While activities under this project continue in other areas, the Akobo portion was suspended. 1996/97 Crop Outcome: According to a USAID Famine Early Warning System bulletin released in late July, a dry spell that affected parts of southern Sudan in May and June will severely affect crop yields in Rumbek and Yirol in Bahr el Ghazal/Lakes and Juba, Torit, and Kapoeta counties in Equatoria in the coming weeks. Although pasture and herd conditions are generally good, NGOs estimate that the dry spell, which also rendered crops more susceptible to damage from insect pests and disease, will reduce first-crop harvests for about 300,000 persons by as much as 65%. Prospects for the second, main-season crop, which represents 60-75% of annual production, depend on the current rains, which arrived late at the end of June and will last until October. Outstanding OLS relief food requirements for 1997 are currently projected at 36,410 MT.  POLITICAL/MILITARY SITUATION GOS Signs Peace Agreement with Rebel Groups: On April 22, the GOS and five rebel factions, including the SSIM and the SPLA/Bahr el Ghazal Group, signed a peace agreement in Khartoum. Under the peace deal, a coordinating council would run the affairs of southern Sudan for four years after which a referendum on the future status of southern Sudan would be held.  Soon after, six factions, including all five signatories to the peace agreement, signed an accord recognizing former Garang ally and SSIM leader Riek Machar as their overall and united militarily under the South Sudan Defense Force. The United States commended the peace agreement as a positive first step, but stressed the need for the GOS to seek a peaceful settlement with other factions.  IGAD Peace Negotiations: From July 8 to 9, President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya hosted a regional summit of Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) members to discuss the war in southern Sudan and Somalia. The GOS, after some initial resistance, finally accepted a declaration of principles as a basis for discussion, clearing the way for the resumption of talks which broke off nearly three years ago. The principles lay the groundwork for discussions regarding the country's return to a secular constitution and a four-year interim administration to address issues surrounding self-determination. Al Bashir also called for a cease- fire with the SPLA during an official visit to South Africa. Both the SPLA and NDA rejected the call for a cease-fire, arguing that it was just a ploy to give the GOS an opportunity to rebuild its forces against advancing SPLA troops. In late August, South African President Nelson Mandela held separate talks with al Bashir and Garang and hosted a summit between al Bashir and Ugandan President Yoweri Musevini. A meeting of East African leaders under the auspices of IGAD, which was originally scheduled for August 19, has been indefinitely postponed. USG Increases Involvement: The United States has stepped up diplomatic efforts to pressure the GOS and other parties to improve the country's poor human rights record and cease hostilities. At the USG's urging, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights is pressuring the GOS to comply with international human rights laws and reduce restrictions on international relief organizations. The USG also backed a recent U.N. Security Council (UNSC) Resolution banning international flights by aircraft owned, leased, or controlled by the already-bankrupt Sudan Airways or another entity of the GOS. Other UNSC sanctions on Sudan restrict international travel for GOS officials and call on nations to reduce the size of Sudanese diplomatic missions abroad and to not hold international conferences in Sudan.  RELIEF EFFORTS IDPs and Returnees Assisted: Coordinated donor- funded relief efforts continue to focus on the highly- variable needs of returnees from Uganda, as well as those displaced by this year's offensive. OLS delivered food and priority relief supplies by road from Yambio and from WFP food stores in Uganda and BHR/OFDA-funded NGOs have been active in the distribution of agricultural inputs and relief kits, health activities, and the rehabilitation of key road routes.  WFP recently initiated an airlift operation into Juba where over 20,000 returnees, most of whom had arrived from Yei, required immediate assistance. WFP barge convoys will deliver nearly 4,000 MT of food and non-food supplies to Juba by the end of September. Nutritional activities, implemented through the BHR/OFDA-funded Action contre la Faim (ACF) grant, also continue.  Three WFP barge convoys successfully delivered over 2,400 MT of food to beneficiaries along the Nile River corridor, despite the looting and attack of one barge convoy in Jonglei reportedly  carried out by SSIM forces. Relief agencies are also responding to rising humanitarian needs among displaced populations in Bahr el Ghazal/Lakes Region. In Khartoum, donors and relief organizations are working with the GOS to ensure that needs continue to be met, despite the demolition and relocation of several IDP camps in the area.  BHR/OFDA and BHR/FFP programs continue to provide food, water, and health care for IDPs in Greater Khartoum. Access to IDPs in and around Khartoum has improved, allowing several therapeutic and supplementary feeding centers to address high levels of wasting.  BHR/OFDA is also funding Save the Children Fund (SC)/US food security and health activities that benefit populations in areas of south Kordofan under GOS control and is funding a small water project through Norwegian People's Aid (NPA), implemented by the Nuba Relief, Rehabilitation, and Development Society (NRRDS) to provide water assistance in areas outside GOS control. SC/US is trying to secure an agreement from the GOS and SPLA to conduct measles vaccinations in rebel-controlled areas. Parts of northern and western Sudan, including Darfur, recently experienced heavy flooding. Casualty figures and details on the full extent of the flooding are unavailable.  In the Red Sea Hills Region, the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC), the Sudanese Red Crescent Society (SRCS), and Oxfam are working to provide food to thousands of drought-stricken Beja nomads, despite numerous logistical and security problems. Oxfam and SRCS also provided supplementary feeding to vulnerable groups in Tokar and Sinkat provinces in response to reports of high levels of wasting and malnutrition in this area. Also, IDPs and war-affected people remain vulnerable and in need of assistance in areas of the Blue Nile that fell under NDA control in January. WFP recently delivered food to four IDP camps in the region.  Disease Outbreaks: Surveys conducted by CARE, International Medical Corps (IMC), and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control have revealed an outbreak of sleeping sickness in Western Equatoria. The team found an overall 19.3% prevalence of the disease in Tambura County, with Ezo town, the epicenter of the disease, reporting a very high 27% prevalence rate. IMC and CARE hope to respond to the outbreak, among the worst documented in this century. Sleeping sickness is a parasitical vector-borne disease that is fatal if untreated. Relapsing fever has also been reported in Mankien, Upper Nile, among new IDPs from Gogrial. Efforts to treat existing cases and control an outbreak of this vector-borne disease, which could cause death if left untreated, are currently underway. An outbreak of relapsing fever recently reported in Twic County is said to be under control and treatment is ongoing. OLS NGOs recently conducted several measles vaccination campaigns following reported cases near Juba, Yei, and Bahr el Jebel, as well as in western Upper Nile and northern Bahr el Ghazal. An outbreak of  gastrointenstitis and cholera reported in Eastern Equatoria is now under control. OLS also conducted vaccinations against rinderpest in Bahr el Ghazal and anthrax in Eastern Equatoria.  OLS Funding Crisis: Despite urgent humanitarian needs, the U.N. scaled back activities, particularly air operations, in southern Sudan for several weeks when funding received for the 1997 U.N. Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for Sudan fell short of the amount requested. The Appeal, which was launched on February 18, requested $120.8 million for 33 projects, of which 29 are OLS projects, in six priority areas. Priority activities supported by the Appeal include emergency food aid and essential health, nutritional, and water activities, as well as overall logistics support, Lokichokio camp management, and security. OLS is conducting a large fund-raising effort and has established a cost-recovery system for air operations and for food and lodging at the Lokichokio base camp. BHR/OFDA has already contributed $2.25 million to UNICEF and $1.3 million to WFP to support OLS operations.  OLS Donors' Meeting: OLS's recent funding difficulties, humanitarian conditions, and access difficulties were the highlights of the U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs' Second International Advisory Committee (IAC) meeting on OLS held in Geneva on June 27. Senior U.N. representatives and donor government representatives, including BHR/OFDA, attended.  The IAC invoked the 1994 OLS Agreements facilitated by IGAD as providing a framework within which OLS should pursue its activities in cooperation with the GOS and the rebel movements rather than trying to negotiate a new access agreement in Sudan. Participants also discussed the status of 1997 OLS programs as well as progress achieved in efforts to reform OLS. After the meeting, Ambassador Van Schaik sent a letter to the GOS requesting action and clarification on access and clearance issues.  Before attending the Geneva meeting, Ambassador Van Schaik traveled to Sudan, Lokichokio, and Nairobi to discuss humanitarian access issues with OLS and representatives from the GOS and SPLA. Ambassador Van Schaik, former Permanent Representative of the Netherlands to the U.N., succeeds Ambassador Vieri Traxler, who resigned last September on account of ill health. ICRC Suspension Continues: ICRC suspended its operations in Sudan following the hijacking of an ICRC plane in November. The aircraft was captured by forces of GOS-ally Kerubino Kwanyin Bol upon landing in Wunrok in Bahr el Ghazal to return five wounded SPLA soldiers.  Four westerners who were on board, including an American pilot, were released  after 38 days, following the intervention of former New Mexico Congressman Bill Richardson, now U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. However, the welfare of the five Sudanese who remain in captivity is unknown. Nine ICRC staff in Juba, held under house arrest since November 1, when this incident began, were released in December. ICRC activities will remain suspended until GOS accusations that the ICRC was transporting arms are put to rest. However, the ICRC hospital in Lokichokio is operating at full capacity and the ICRC continues to work with Sudanese prisoners in Uganda and Sudan. ICRC recently sent food to Juba hospital under the auspices of the SRCS. Later in March, an OLS aircraft was detained in Bor, Jonglei province, by GOS authorities claiming that flight clearance for the aircraft had not yet reached them. The GOS officials accused the pilot of carrying sensitive documents to rebels and held him for seven weeks until, following the intervention of senior U.N. officials, he was released on May 2. The documents in question reportedly were flight log books and aviation maps.  Refugees: In line with an agreement between Sudan, Ethiopia, and the UNHCR, the last 23,000 Ethiopian refugees in eastern Sudan are expected to be voluntarily repatriated this year.  Of this group, about 7,000 Ethiopians were repatriated between May and July. Effective May, Eritrea suspended UNHCR staff from Eritrea over disagreements about the repatriation of refugees from Sudan. UNHCR is currently investigating high mortality rates among IDPs and refugees in Juba, particularly among 800 or so refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo.  USG ASSISTANCE TO SUDAN The USG has actively been providing humanitarian assistance to Sudan since 1988. On October 28, 1996, U.S. Ambassador to Sudan, Timothy Carney, renewed the disaster declaration for Sudan for FY 1997, stating that continued U.S. assistance is required to assist over 3 million war-affected and displaced Sudanese. Currently, the USG's humanitarian response to the emergency in Sudan is provided through BHR/OFDA, BHR/FFP, and the State Department's Bureau for Population, Refugee, and Migration (PRM). USG- funded programs in Sudan promote continuing emergency relief to populations at risk, while at the same time providing rehabilitation assistance that builds local capacity to meet their own needs. This goal is captured under the recently-approved USG Integrated Strategy Plan for Sudan 1997-1999, which was developed within the context of the complex emergency in Sudan and takes into consideration current legislative restrictions on providing development aid to Sudan.

BHR/OFDA and BHR/FFP staff in Washington continue to work with the USAID/Regional Economic Development Services Offices/Sudan Field Office to plan and monitor relief and rehabilitation activities in southern Sudan and with USAID/Khartoum staff to monitor activities in northern Sudan and GOS- controlled areas of the south. In January 1996, the United States suspended its diplomatic presence in Khartoum, due to concerns for the safety of American Embassy personnel in Sudan. Subsequently, Ambassador Carney established a temporary office in Nairobi to maintain regular diplomatic communications with the GOS.

The three-week project is designed to avert the threat of extensive new flooding in the country, already hard-hit by devastating floods in 1995 and 1996 as well as by drought this year. WFP will disstribute 12,750 metric tons of food rations to 370,000 North Koreans repairing 288 kilometres of dikes destroyed two weeks ago along the western coast of north Korea in South and North Pyongan and South Hwanghae provinces. The food will come from a 100,000-ton US donation to help relieve hunger in the country. For the first time, US non-governmental organisations will be permitted to monitor distribution, Staff of Care, Mercy Corps, Catholic Relief services, Amigos Internacionales and World Vision are already in the country and will act as monitors. The rations will benefit more than one million North Koreans because workers with dependents will receive extra rations for their families.

PART I - HIGHLIGHTS (Details below in Part II) A. DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA 1. Update a) FAO/WFP mission to DPR Korea assesses effects of this summer's drought. Sea water intrusion in connection with Typhoon Winnie aggravates food security situation. Food outlook for 1998 grim. PART II - DETAILS A. DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA 1. UPDATE 1.1 Drought situation - report of the FAO/WFP crop and food supply mission a) FAO and WFP on 11 September issued a Special Alert (No. 277) following a joint crop and food supply assessment mission to DPR Korea. The mission was fielded to assess the effects of this summer's prolonged drought. However, as the mission was in the country, Typhoon Winnie struck. The mission was requested to make a preliminary assessment of this damage as well. b) The agricultural season started favourably with well above normal rainfall in May. However, a serious drought followed, extending from June to mid-August. During this period, precipitation was reduced to between 14 and 40 percent of normal levels. Moreover, it appeared that after the heavy rainfall in May, the water level in some rain-fed reservoirs was deliberately reduced for fear that continued rain in June and July would cause overflowing and thus flooding, as in the previous two years. c) In all reservoirs seen by the mission, the water supplies had been either totally exhausted or were well below capacity. Adequate and sustained rainfall in September would come too late to have but a limited effect on the maize production although it would still save a major part of the paddy crop. If the reservoirs are not replenished, land preparation and planting of the 1998 crops in April/May will be compromised by water shortage. d) The negative effects of the lack of water were quite obvious, the mission reported. While maize with adequate irrigation, generally from major rivers, was in good shape, crops under rainfed, non-irrigated conditions were highly stunted and had developed poor grains or none at all. e) By the time of the mission the rice crop needed a further five to six weeks to reach maturity. Should the crop receive assured irrigation for at least another three weeks, production could still be adequate, but absence of water at this critical stage would result in a serious reduction in yields. f) Reports received since the end of the mission indicate that rainfall in the first half of September has been limited, and irregular. Domestic production this year will, therefore, depend heavily on areas which are irrigated from main rivers rather than from rainfed reservoirs. 1.2 Typhoon Winnie a) To aggravate an already serious situation, Typhoon Winnie, originating in the East China Sea, hit DPR Korea between 18 and 22 August. Although the typhoon in the initial stage brought much needed rainfall, high winds and tides destroyed protective sea dikes along the western coast. b) The most serious effect on agriculture was the infiltration of sea water into paddy areas. In the most serious cases observed by the mission, sea water had penetrated as far as six kilometres inland. A large number of houses were destroyed with some loss of lives reported. c) As an immediate response, WFP and a consortium of American non-governmental organizations have agreed to use a US special contribution to support a food-for-work project for the repair of 288 kilometres of dikes. Work was initiated within a few days of the disaster. 1.3 Food security outlook a) The food prospects for 1998 appear to be worse than in the previous two years. Domestic production of cereals is expected to cover less than half of the country's food needs. Commercial imports are likely to remain strained. Furthermore, as commercial imports last year were highly dependent on barter trade with China, the fact that the current drought also seriously affected crop production in the neighbouring Chinese province might reduce surpluses and the volume of the cross-border trade in 1998. It would thus seem that DPR Korea will depend on an even greater scale on international food aid next year. b) Another joint FAO/WFP mission has been scheduled for October, when it will be possible to estimate more accurately the 1997 production outcome. The results will form the basis for a decision on continuing WFP assistance throughout 1998. 1.4 The Special Report will be available in full in the near future on the Internet at the Web site of the FAO Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture, at http://www.fao.org/giews/giewse.htm - then click on Special Reports.","WFP Emergency Report No. 37 of 1997: Democratic People's Republic of Korea Issued weekly by the United Nations World Food Programme Report No. 37 of 1997  Date: 12 September 1997 This report includes: A) Democratic People's Republic of Korea B) Southern Africa: El Nino Watch C) East and Central Africa: Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo and Republic of Congo (Brazzaville) D) West Africa: Sierra Leone E) Recently approved WFP Emergency and Protracted Relief Operations.

141,32546,[4593],Food and Nutrition,North Korea Food Crisis: Weekly Update #1,"Background  The alarming food shortages in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) has led to an international humanitarian relief effort, in which CARE USA and four other aid agencies are distributing and monitoring 55,000 metric tons of food donated by the U.S. Government. The Food Aid and Monitoring Support Project will help the most vulnerable portions of Korean society - children, women, and the elderly - to survive until the harvest next month.   The consortium of aid agencies is now fully operational, working from a temporary office in Pyongyang. The agencies are:  ° CARE USA  ° Catholic Relief Services  ° Amigos Internacionales  ° Mercy Corps International  ° World Vision Relief and Development  The consortium communicate regularly with the North Korean Government's Flood Damage Rehabilitation Commission (FDRC), the World Food Programme (WFP) office in Pyongyang, and the various headquarters concerned.   Recent Developments  Division of Food  The first food shipment of nearly 25,000 metric tons arrived Aug. 25 aboard the Judy Litrico. Three additional shipments are scheduled to arrive in the coming weeks. The consortium of aid agencies will monitor 55,000 metric tons, while the WFP will monitor an additional 45,000 metric tons. However, all three parties (WFP, FDRC, and the aid agencies) will agree on overall programmatic and distribution plans.   Responding to Typhoon Winnie  The intensity of activity around CARE's response to the humanitarian crisis in North Korea stepped up considerably in the wake of the country's August 22 bout with Typhoon Winnie. Winds and tidal surges created severe damage to protective dikes and planted fields in three southern provinces (North Pyongan, South Pyongan, and South Huanghae).   The Typhoon affected 22 counties in three provinces: North Pyongan, South Pyongan, and South Huanghae. The North Korean Government estimates that 2.8 million people were affected by the storm, with 29,000 people made homeless. The government also reported significant agricultural losses, including 107,625 hectares of damaged land and 700,000 metric tons of lost cereal crops. Nearly 1,000 sea dikes were also destroyed. CARE is working to verify the damage reports from independent sources.   After assessments in several counties and discussions with WFP and the U.S. Agency for International Development, CARE and the other agencies directed 12,750 metric tons of the relief food to victims of the typhoon through a food-for-work project to repair the damaged dikes. The program will provide critically needed support to more than 371,000 households for a period of 21 days, until they can reap the harvest of their own fields in early October.   The following table indicates how the food will be distributed:       Beneficiary Type  Number   Allocation  Days  Total Allocation  Workers w/ families   247,813  2 kg/day  21 days  10,408 MT  Single Workers   123, 907  0.9 kg/day  21 days  2,342 MT  TOTAL   371,720        12,750 MT    Monitoring Plans  In order to ensure that the food (in both the food-for-work and regular programs) reaches its intended beneficiaries without overlapping with other programs, the consortium has paid careful attention to developing detailed and realistic plans for:  ° Monitoring the movement of the food.  ° Monitoring how the food is distributed and used.  ° Measuring the impact of the food aid on communities.  The consortium is currently focusing on the food-for-work program, and the details of later distributions will be completed over the next week.   Monitoring will ensue in two phases:   1. Over a 10-day period, the full consortium team will visit all 22 counties targeted for food distribution.   2. Three smaller groups will then take intensive oversight of each province. The FDRC has provided the consortium with three vehicles, while the WFP and the Korean government are providing logistical support.  Other Consortium Activities  One victim of the typhoon's surges and tidal wave was the largest North Korean salt production facility, located on the country's western coast. This being the time for production of kim-chi, a local staple food item consisting of salted-dried cabbage, the loss of 120,000 metric tons of salt presents yet another threat to the ability of North Koreans to weather the winter. In response to a request from the FDRC, CARE has allocated $5,000 from its Emergency Response Fund for the purchase of salt from China, and Catholic Relief Services is matching this amount.   Other CARE Activities  North Korea has recognized the presence of two CARE entities in the country: the CARE USA representation in the consortium of aid agencies; and CARE International, represented by a staff member from CARE Australia who is monitoring the use of the 1,000 metric tons of fertilizer procured by CARE Norge with funding from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. CARE International is also assessing the possibilities for other, non-food assistance to the North Korean population. With the winter season fast approaching and most belongings washed away by Winnie's tidal wave, CARE International will, in the short term, purchase warm clothing for children, using funds secured by CARE Deutschland. In the longer term, CARE International is exploring several possibilities, including a range of food security initiatives such as greenhouses, family food plots (seeds and tools), and small animal husbandry. Water and sanitation projects in the capital, Pyongyang, are also being considered.    CARE 151 Ellis Street NE Atlanta, GA 30303-2439 1-800-521-CARE, ext. 999 info@care.org  ","North Korea Food Crisis: Weekly Update #1 Background  The alarming food shortages in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) has led to an international humanitarian relief effort, in which CARE USA and four other aid agencies are distributing and monitoring 55,000 metric tons of food donated by the U.S. Government. The Food Aid and Monitoring Support Project will help the most vulnerable portions of Korean society - children, women, and the elderly - to survive until the harvest next month.   The consortium of aid agencies is now fully operational, working from a temporary office in Pyongyang. The agencies are:  ° CARE USA  ° Catholic Relief Services  ° Amigos Internacionales  ° Mercy Corps International  ° World Vision Relief and Development  The consortium communicate regularly with the North Korean Government's Flood Damage Rehabilitation Commission (FDRC), the World Food Programme (WFP) office in Pyongyang, and the various headquarters concerned.   Recent Developments  Division of Food  The first food shipment of nearly 25,000 metric tons arrived Aug. 25 aboard the Judy Litrico. Three additional shipments are scheduled to arrive in the coming weeks. The consortium of aid agencies will monitor 55,000 metric tons, while the WFP will monitor an additional 45,000 metric tons. However, all three parties (WFP, FDRC, and the aid agencies) will agree on overall programmatic and distribution plans.   Responding to Typhoon Winnie  The intensity of activity around CARE's response to the humanitarian crisis in North Korea stepped up considerably in the wake of the country's August 22 bout with Typhoon Winnie. Winds and tidal surges created severe damage to protective dikes and planted fields in three southern provinces (North Pyongan, South Pyongan, and South Huanghae).   The Typhoon affected 22 counties in three provinces: North Pyongan, South Pyongan, and South Huanghae. The North Korean Government estimates that 2.8 million people were affected by the storm, with 29,000 people made homeless. The government also reported significant agricultural losses, including 107,625 hectares of damaged land and 700,000 metric tons of lost cereal crops. Nearly 1,000 sea dikes were also destroyed. CARE is working to verify the damage reports from independent sources.   After assessments in several counties and discussions with WFP and the U.S. Agency for International Development, CARE and the other agencies directed 12,750 metric tons of the relief food to victims of the typhoon through a food-for-work project to repair the damaged dikes. The program will provide critically needed support to more than 371,000 households for a period of 21 days, until they can reap the harvest of their own fields in early October.   The following table indicates how the food will be distributed:       Beneficiary Type  Number   Allocation  Days  Total Allocation  Workers w/ families   247,813  2 kg/day  21 days  10,408 MT  Single Workers   123, 907  0.9 kg/day  21 days  2,342 MT  TOTAL   371,720        12,750 MT    Monitoring Plans  In order to ensure that the food (in both the food-for-work and regular programs) reaches its intended beneficiaries without overlapping with other programs, the consortium has paid careful attention to developing detailed and realistic plans for:  ° Monitoring the movement of the food.  ° Monitoring how the food is distributed and used.  ° Measuring the impact of the food aid on communities.  The consortium is currently focusing on the food-for-work program, and the details of later distributions will be completed over the next week.   Monitoring will ensue in two phases:   1. Over a 10-day period, the full consortium team will visit all 22 counties targeted for food distribution.   2. Three smaller groups will then take intensive oversight of each province. The FDRC has provided the consortium with three vehicles, while the WFP and the Korean government are providing logistical support.  Other Consortium Activities  One victim of the typhoon's surges and tidal wave was the largest North Korean salt production facility, located on the country's western coast. This being the time for production of kim-chi, a local staple food item consisting of salted-dried cabbage, the loss of 120,000 metric tons of salt presents yet another threat to the ability of North Koreans to weather the winter. In response to a request from the FDRC, CARE has allocated $5,000 from its Emergency Response Fund for the purchase of salt from China, and Catholic Relief Services is matching this amount.   Other CARE Activities  North Korea has recognized the presence of two CARE entities in the country: the CARE USA representation in the consortium of aid agencies; and CARE International, represented by a staff member from CARE Australia who is monitoring the use of the 1,000 metric tons of fertilizer procured by CARE Norge with funding from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. CARE International is also assessing the possibilities for other, non-food assistance to the North Korean population. With the winter season fast approaching and most belongings washed away by Winnie's tidal wave, CARE International will, in the short term, purchase warm clothing for children, using funds secured by CARE Deutschland. In the longer term, CARE International is exploring several possibilities, including a range of food security initiatives such as greenhouses, family food plots (seeds and tools), and small animal husbandry. Water and sanitation projects in the capital, Pyongyang, are also being considered.

142,32564,[4593],Food and Nutrition,North Korea Food Crisis: Weekly Update #2,"  September 12, 1997 Background  Further evidence emerging last week from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) leaves little doubt that the nation faces a significant food crisis with the potential to cause tremendous human suffering and political and economic havoc. Reports from China and from recent visitors to North Korea indicate increasing desperation among hungry North Koreans and dangerously depleted levels of food availability.   Simultaneously, the U.S. response to the famine gained new impetus as the first shipments of U.S. government food commodities arrived in Pyongyang. CARE and the consortium of humanitarian agencies involved in the relief effort began moving the food to participants in a disaster rehabilitation program. The program will provide 371,720 North Koreans families with daily food rations in exchange for work on restoring dams and dikes destroyed by Typhoon Winnie.   Additional food, scheduled to arrive in the coming months, will be distributed to schools and senior-citizen centers to help those institutions continue to serve North Korea's most vulnerable populations during the food crisis.   The consortium of aid agencies is now fully operational, working from a temporary office in Pyongyang. The agencies are:  =B0 CARE USA  =B0 Catholic Relief Services  =B0 Amigos Internacionales  =B0 Mercy Corps International  =B0 World Vision Relief and Development  The consortium communicates regularly with the North Korean Government's Flood Damage Rehabilitation Commission (FDRC), the World Food Programme (WFP) office in Pyongyang, and the various headquarters concerned.   Recent Developments  Phase 1: Typhoon Relief Project Begins Activities  After the inter-agency agreement was signed on Sept. 4, monitoring activities began last week for a food-for-work (FFW) project that will provide daily rations to 371,000 families affected by Typhoon Winnie in exchange for their work on dikes damaged by the storm. The team surveyed initial activities in five counties, and is moving forward with the WFP and the FDRC on recommendations for improved commodity management and allocation.   Phase II: Reaching Children and the Elderly  In addition to the typhoon relief program, the consortium is developing plans to distribute the balance of the 55,000 metric tons of food across the entire country to nearly 3 million North Koreans between now and November 1997. Last week, the consortium shared with the WFP and the FDRC a draft distribution plan that targets populations currently neglected by food distributions programs -- namely, children aged 7-11 and the elderly. The plan calls for institutional feeding at schools and senior citizen centers and also targets heads of households through a food-for work program reaching 250,000 households. As reflected in the table below, the child feeding program will attempt to cover the entire country (with attention paid to ensure no overlap with food provided by other sources), while the senior citizen and food-for-work programs will focus in the eastern provinces of North and South Hamgyong and southern Ryangang.   Draft Distribution Plan:  =A0      Population  Number  Location  Allocation  Days  Total  Children aged 7-11  2,150,000  Country-wide  250 g / day  42  22,575 MT  Elderly  490,740  N. Hamgyong; S.

The report stresses that the coming weeks will be the most critical in North Korea, as families await the harvest period in late September. It states that the food being provided through the World Food Program and the humanitarian consortium is ""saving lives.""   ""It was clear,"" write the two staffers, Mark Kirk and Amos Hochstein, ""that many children depend almost entirely on the food donated by the international community to survive."" The report also notes that the Government of North Korea must abide by its commitment to allow the food monitors free access to distribution activities, and that future assistance must be made conditional on the government's support of a fair and effective relief effort.   The Kirk-Hochstein report also makes a strong recommendation to consider expanding the scope of U.S. bilateral assistance to include medical and oral rehydration therapy supplies. Hospital stores of these critical basic medicines are dangerously low, and health centers cannot keep up with the flow of patients. In summary, the visitors said they found that the presence of the humanitarian consortium is an important support to the success of the WFP food distribution, and that the group should continue its work in North Korea for as long as large-scale international assistance is necessary.   Other CARE Activities  CARE USA is seeking additional donations of food to augment the aid being provided through the humanitarian consortium. With hunger far exceeding available food supplies, CARE hopes to find additional donors to help meet the urgent need for food. With CARE already operational, there is a significant opportunity to ensure effective food distribution and help head off the growing food crisis.   With German support, CARE International has initiated procurement for its project to purchase and distribute winter clothing. CARE International is also developing a longer-term strategy focusing on food security.

FEED WILL INCLUDE A ""TEASER"" RECORDED BY BELIDA WHILE IN MINEFIELD. INTRO: ANGOLA IS ONE OF THE MOST-HEAVILY MINED COUNTRIES IN THE  WORLD -- A LEGACY OF ITS YEARS OF CIVIL WAR. HUNDREDS OF  ANGOLAN AND FOREIGN EXPERTS ARE NOW DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF  THE COUNTRY, TRYING TO REMOVE THE MILLIONS OF LAND MINES AND  OTHER PIECES OF UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE. V-O-A SOUTHERN AFRICA  CORRESPONDENT ALEX BELIDA HAS JUST COMPLETED A TRIP TO ANGOLA,  DURING WHICH HE FOCUSED ON ITS LAND MINE PROBLEM. HE VISITED  WITH DE-MINERS HARD AT WORK OUTSIDE THE AIRFIELD AT HUAMBO IN  ANGOLA'S CENTRAL HIGHLANDS. TEXT: THE ANGOLAN DE-MINER WEARING A HEAVY FLAK JACKET AND A HELMET  WITH A THICK PLEXIGLASS VISOR IS SWEATING UNDER THE INTENSE SUN.  BUT THE PRESSURE AND TENSION REALLY BEGIN TO MOUNT WHEN HIS METAL DETECTOR GOES OFF. HE MAKES TWO OR THREE MORE PASSES WITH THE  DEVICE, THEN SETS IT ASIDE ... CAREFULLY. HE THEN TAKES A SLENDER METAL ROD AND BEGINS TO POKE THE EARTH -- VERY CAREFULLY. THEN  HE BEGINS BRUSHING AWAY THE SOIL AND EXPOSES THE MINE -- VERY,  VERY CAREFULLY. LATER IT IS ACTUALLY REMOVED AND DETONATED SAFELY.  THAT WAS A RUSSIAN-MADE MINE. ITS MORE THAN 200 GRAMS OF  EXPLOSIVE CREATED A HUGE PLUME OF BLACK SMOKE. THIS MINE WOULD  DO MORE THAN JUST TEAR OFF A LEG. IT WOULD KILL. THE MINEFIELD WHERE IT WAS FOUND EXTENDS FOR 10 KILOMETERS AROUND HUAMBO AIRPORT. IT WAS PLANTED BY CUBAN SOLDIERS BACK WHEN THEY  WERE FIGHTING ALONGSIDE ONE OF ANGOLA'S RIVAL FACTIONS DURING THE COUNTRY'S LONG AND BLOODY CIVIL WAR. THE MINES ARE LAID IN WHAT  APPEARS TO BE AN ORGANIZED FASHION AT DISTANCES FROM TWO METERS  TO 50-CENTIMETERS APART. BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM, ACCORDING TO  CARLOS NIELSEN, AN ARGENTINE MARINE ENGINEER WHO IS WITH THE  JOINT UNITED NATIONS-ANGOLAN GOVERNMENT DE-MINING OPERATION.

FEED WILL INCLUDE A ""TEASER"" RECORDED BY BELIDA WHILE IN MINEFIELD. INTRO: ANGOLA IS ONE OF THE MOST-HEAVILY MINED COUNTRIES IN THE  WORLD -- A LEGACY OF ITS YEARS OF CIVIL WAR. HUNDREDS OF  ANGOLAN AND FOREIGN EXPERTS ARE NOW DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF  THE COUNTRY, TRYING TO REMOVE THE MILLIONS OF LAND MINES AND  OTHER PIECES OF UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE. V-O-A SOUTHERN AFRICA  CORRESPONDENT ALEX BELIDA HAS JUST COMPLETED A TRIP TO ANGOLA,  DURING WHICH HE FOCUSED ON ITS LAND MINE PROBLEM. HE VISITED  WITH DE-MINERS HARD AT WORK OUTSIDE THE AIRFIELD AT HUAMBO IN  ANGOLA'S CENTRAL HIGHLANDS. TEXT: THE ANGOLAN DE-MINER WEARING A HEAVY FLAK JACKET AND A HELMET  WITH A THICK PLEXIGLASS VISOR IS SWEATING UNDER THE INTENSE SUN.  BUT THE PRESSURE AND TENSION REALLY BEGIN TO MOUNT WHEN HIS METAL DETECTOR GOES OFF. HE MAKES TWO OR THREE MORE PASSES WITH THE  DEVICE, THEN SETS IT ASIDE ... CAREFULLY. HE THEN TAKES A SLENDER METAL ROD AND BEGINS TO POKE THE EARTH -- VERY CAREFULLY. THEN  HE BEGINS BRUSHING AWAY THE SOIL AND EXPOSES THE MINE -- VERY,  VERY CAREFULLY. LATER IT IS ACTUALLY REMOVED AND DETONATED SAFELY.  THAT WAS A RUSSIAN-MADE MINE. ITS MORE THAN 200 GRAMS OF  EXPLOSIVE CREATED A HUGE PLUME OF BLACK SMOKE. THIS MINE WOULD  DO MORE THAN JUST TEAR OFF A LEG. IT WOULD KILL. THE MINEFIELD WHERE IT WAS FOUND EXTENDS FOR 10 KILOMETERS AROUND HUAMBO AIRPORT. IT WAS PLANTED BY CUBAN SOLDIERS BACK WHEN THEY  WERE FIGHTING ALONGSIDE ONE OF ANGOLA'S RIVAL FACTIONS DURING THE COUNTRY'S LONG AND BLOODY CIVIL WAR. THE MINES ARE LAID IN WHAT  APPEARS TO BE AN ORGANIZED FASHION AT DISTANCES FROM TWO METERS  TO 50-CENTIMETERS APART.

145,32679,[4593],Food and Nutrition,North Korea Food Crisis Weekly Update #3,"Situation Update A clearer picture is emerging of the food crisis in North Korea, with eyewitness accounts relating a grim prognosis for the coming harvests while attesting that international food aid is helping to prevent famine from sweeping the country.  Reports from expatriate Koreans in China and from recent emigrants interviewed by World Vision paints a picture of continued suffering.  And a joint report released last week by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme describes an even worse outlook than expected, both in the immediate future and over the next year.  According to the report, this year's harvest will cover less than half the population's minimum food needs, while in the coming season dangerously low levels of water reserves will threaten the country with even poorer output.  ""There will be an even greater dependence on international assistance for food, agricultural rehabilitation and vital inputs of seed and fertilizers..."" the report states, adding that without which ""the human consequences are likely to be dire."" Recent Developments Typhoon-Response Food-for-Work Activities The monitoring team from the consortium of U.S. aid agencies has completed its first round of monitoring for the food-for-work (FFW) program, making physical inspections in 19 of the 22 counties being covered.  This FFW program plans to distribute 8,140 metric tons of food commodities to families affected by Typhoon Winnie in exchange for repair work to dikes damaged by the storm. The team's initial findings indicates good progress in allocating food to beneficiaries in the most severely damaged areas.  The team will make additional visits when future food shipments reach the same geographic area.  Other Feeding Program The third shipment of U.S. food to arrive in North Korea is expected to unload at the end of this month in a port on the nation's eastern coast.  This marks a shift away from the country's largest port of N'ampo, near the west-coast capital of Pyongyang, in order to prevent any bias in the allocation of food towards the western half of the country.  The 19,000 metric tons of commodity aboard this third ship, the Overseas Harriet, will be targeted primarily along the eastern provinces, including the troubled northeastern province of Ryanggang.  Other CARE Activities A contribution of 1,680 metric tons of fertilizer, secured by CARE Norge from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has been allotted to 25 cooperative farms in six provinces.  CARE USA had already targeted these farms to receive a significant donation of seeds -- enough to produce 14,000 metric tons of maize, which can feed 600,000 people for two months.  The Director of Korean Affairs at Mercy Corps International has been monitoring the use of these grants through Mercy Corps' partnership with CARE, and will report on how poor rains and early harvesting may have affected these projections.  While continuing to be a leader in the response to North Korea's food crisis through its participation in the five-member consortium of aid agencies, CARE USA launched renewed efforts this week to secure additional funding for both short-term food and longer-term development assistance. CARE USA is seeking to provide inputs such as seeds and fertilizer, and to broaden and deepen the scope of international assistance to vulnerable households in North Korea. Toward that end, CARE USA has developed a proposal to raise $1 million from private funding sources in the United States and from friends of Korea overseas.  At the same time, CARE International has developed a multi-intervention proposal to address a range of needs identified over the last month by Simon Williamson, a CARE Australia official.  The proposal, titled Food Security for Children in Nurseries and Kindergartens in the DPRK,  seeks $120,000 to enhance the food security of children by assisting 30 nurseries in the production of vegetables and small livestock.  It is being circulated among CARE International member countries.  About the Consortium in Pyongyang CARE is the lead agency in the humanitarian consortium in Pyongyang, which is a partnership of major American organizations committed to international relief and socioeconomic development.  The consortium is working in North Korea under the aegis of the World Food Programme and in collaboration with the North Korean Flood Damage and Rehabilitation Committee.

147,32713,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,IFRC Great Lakes Situation report No 2,"RWANDAN AND BURUNDIAN REFUGEES & RWANDA COUNTRY OPERATIONS Period covered: May 1 - May 20 With the fall of Kinshasa to the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) and the exit of President Mobutu Sese Seko the Great Lakes region has seen a significant political change. The leader of the newly-named Democratic Republic of Congo, Laurent Kabila has banned political activities and demonstrations, in the wake of his decision not to give former Prime Minster Etienne Tshisekedi a post in Cabinet. Elections, a key demand of the UN and many Western nations, will not be held for at least two years. Red Cross activities in the region are stepping up due to the continuing population movements -- at the time of writing some 120,000 refugees managed to escape rebel advances and started to cross into some neighbouring countries.  The context The Red Cross Societies of Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire, with the support of the International Federation, provide assistance to refugees, displaced people, returnees and vulnerable groups who have been placed at risk by conflict, war and disease in much of the Great Lakes region. The operation, and hence the scope of this situation report, has changed radically since the Appeal was drawn up in late 1996. Latest events Democratic Republic of Congo  On Friday 16 May President Mobutu relinquished power and left Kinshasa. The next day Laurent Kabila declared himself President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the new name for the country. The take-over did not trigger the all-out final battle that had been anticipated by some (although over 200 died during and after the fall of Kinshasa), but sparked the movement of a new group of refugees into neighbouring countries. The death of 91 refugees in a crush on an ADFL train from Biaro to Kisangani on May 4 brought condemnation from the Rwandan Government of the UN, which in turn accused the ADFL of overcrowding the wagons. Although humanitarian organisations had difficulties with the numbers arriving at Kisangani, UNHCR managed to reach its target of airlifting 2,000 refugees per day to Rwanda. Access to refugees still hiding in the forest is still sporadic and difficult. Rwanda  Confrontation between ex-Forces Armees Rwandaises/Interahamwe and Government forces persists, especially in the north-east. Attacks on individuals and soft targets (schools, priests) continue. On 11 May six people were killed in Nyakizu -- the first attack in Butare prefecture which up till now had been spared from the violence. Over 45,000 returnees have entered Rwanda by road/rail/air since the new influx started in mid-April. On arrival they are brought to the central transit centre at Runda, are screened, registered and leave for their home villages within 24 hours. Burundi  More than 800 people have been killed recently in the Southern part of the country where fighting between government troops and rebels has intensified. Peace negotiations in Rome are not expected to yield great results. Bujumbura is still calm, although some fighting is ongoing 15 km from the city. The five Northern provinces where the Federation and the Burundi Red Cross operate are calm. Although the economic sanctions imposed on the country in 1996 by the region were softened by the partial lifting of bans on medicine, food, agricultural products, educational and construction material, they still have a strong effect. The problem of internally displaced persons, especially in 'regroupement' camps remains unsolved. The country is also facing a louse-borne typhus epidemic with almost 24,000 cases reported up to 15 May. Tanzania  Western Tanzania still receives the brunt of the fall out from instability in Burundi and Democratic Republic of Congo/former Zaire. Refugee camps along the Burundian border receive a daily average of up to 600 new refugees. Ongoing drought in the Northeast of the country affecting 610,00 people has prompted the government and Action by Churches Together to launch an appeal to assist the stricken population. Congo Approximately 20,000 Rwandan refugees including groups of armed elements crossed the Zaire river in the latter part of May. Most were in a precarious state of health through malnutrition and consumption of polluted water. The Congolese authorities have confirmed their willingness to accept these refugees but want to have the ex-FAR/Interahamwe separated from the other refugees. UNHCR has been asked by the government to repatriate these refugees in the shortest possible time. Red Cross/Red Crescent action Democratic Republic of Congo National Red Cross teams were highly active, supporting refugees wherever they could be reached and more recently removing the dead from the streets in Kinshasa. The Federation has a delegation in place (HOD, Logistics, Relief, Development, DPP ) to support the National Society in the following programmes: Assistance to 2,000 vulnerable persons (children under five, pregnant and lactating women, elderly and handicapped) with high protein biscuits, soap and with 1,000 mt of maize from WFP in 20 supplementary feeding centres in Kinshasa; Distribution of 765 mt of maize to Rwandan refugees in Mbandaka; the delegation facilitated this WFP donation to the National Red Cross Society;  Health care and educational services for 25,000 Cabindan refugees in the region of Matadi (Bas-Zaire); Planning the process of rehabilitation and institutional development: the leadership of the National Society will visit all regional committees, starting on 16 June with Goma, Bukavu, Kindu and Kisangani, in order to evaluate the needs for rehabilitation in the regions both for the population and the Red Cross Society. They will concentrate their efforts on health and health-related projects. This process will also include efforts for regional general assemblies in preparation for the national general assembly of this Red Cross Society. Implementation of the Disaster Preparedness and Prevention programme started in late March with a training workshop for staff of the then Zaire Red Cross Society, conducted by the regional DPP delegate. After this workshop six three-person teams went to six locations in the regions of Equateur, Bandundu, Kinshasa and Bas-Zaire and passed on their training to 1,394 volunteers and office bearers in regional and local committees. This training proved crucial once the Rwandan refugees arrived in Mbandaka and the then Zaire Red Cross volunteers assisted them through registration, assessment of needs, distribution of food and non-food items, First Aid and basic health services in co-operation with the local authorities. This training programme will continue once access to all regions is again possible. The regional committees will be reinforced by the establishment of small DPP stocks in each region, a countrywide telecommunication system (pactor), as well as basic logistical means. Rwanda  In July, the delegation will attempt to reassess the security situation, in co-operation with UNHCR and other agencies. If conditions are good, extra elements of the original rehabilitation plan, including social support and the improvement of food security, will be budgeted for and started at the end of July. Meanwhile, Rwandan Red Cross Society (RRCS)/Federation rehabilitation activities continue with the construction of approximately 150 houses on a first site in Kibungo prefecture and construction due to start on a second site. More sites are being identified leaving more room for Participating National Societies' involvement in the project. A basic agreement has been reached with the Ministry of Health on a strategy to start a nation-wide Community Based First Aid (CBFA) project. Burundi  A plan of action has been approved by the Federation to combat a typhus epidemic targeting 500,000 people following the worst outbreak in 50 years, affecting 24,000 people in six provinces. The Burundi Red Cross Society is training its volunteers on the distribution and use of permethrine and on the prevention of health hazards related to its use. Meanwhile, capacity-building activities continue. An assessment mission to study actual needs and possible Red Cross action is scheduled to take place in June. Tanzania  A new co-operation agreement was signed with the Tanzanian Red Cross Society (TRCS) giving it more operational responsibilities in joint TRCS/Federation operations. The co-operation agreement's main goal was to re-establish a partnership in which both parties felt they had ownership of the programmes involved. The next few months should be viewed as a transition period in which progressively more responsibility will be handed over to the TRCS. The Federation is not pulling out of the operation, nor abdicating its responsibility to support the TRCS. Similarly, the Federation is not abandoning its commitments to the Participating National Societies and Donor Agencies and assures them that their funds and contributions are used in accordance to the guidelines under which they were committed. The agreement has resulted not only in increased joint planning but also in a better team spirit in Lugufu. A similar evolution should be expected with regard to the Kasulu activities. The Federation and the TRCS continue to operate refugee camps in Lugufu (46,000 Zairians) Myovosi (42,000 Burundians) and Mtabila (40,000 Burundians). The TRCS manages a camp for 90,000 Burundians in Lukole, under an agreement with UNHCR. The rainy season has made life more difficult in all camps but especially Lugufu, which is the last on UNHCR's list for closure in the event of large-scale repatriation to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Installation of a water delivery system in Lugufu, improvements in the sanitation and vector control in all camps is being initiated. The Red Cross will move ahead with an effort to manufacture and distribute treated mosquito nets in the camps, as recommended by UNHCR. The campaign benefits will be two-fold: mosquito control, and income generation for the beneficiaries who make the nets. Uganda  Kisoro camp was closed on 17 May, when the last 528 of 1,941 refugees were transferred to the Kyangwali settlement camp in Hoima district. At its peak last year some 10,300 refugees were in Kisoro. Transfer of refugees from Matanda camp (which hosted 181 refugees on May 13) will start within a few weeks. Nakivale hosts 2,677 refugees who are not yet planned for transfer. The last camp, Orukinga had 11,067 refugees on 13 May. Approximately 3,000 of these will soon be transferred to Kahunge. Congo  So far 20,000 refugees from Democratic Republic of Congo/former Zaire have crossed the river dividing the two countries. During Congolese Red Cross Society (CRCS) assessment missions dressing kits were left behind to allow local RC branches to continue their support to the refugees. A medical kit, plastic sheeting and high protein biscuits were sent with MSF to Matipotoko. Three barges were sent by the government to pick up refugees north of Brazzaville and bring them to a transit centre at Bilolo, where 25 CRC volunteers under the supervision of the national relief co-ordinator registered them, organised the camp, distributed blankets, plastic sheeting, tarpaulins and food aid and co-ordinated the different agencies involved: MSF for healthcare, Oxfam for water and Atlas for logistics. CRCS took up responsibilities for registration, camp management, distributions and education in health and sanitation. A contract between UNHCR, CRCS and the Federation for this operation is being finalised. The Federation's regional relief co-ordinator acts as facilitator for all relevant meetings, assessment missions and co-ordination. Central African Republic  Due to the events in Democratic Republic of Congo/former Zaire, the CAR received 7,000 refugees from Zaire and Rwanda. For the time being most of them are living in border villages. The CAR Red Cross Society has developed an emergency plan to cope with the influx of larger groups of refugees. Outstanding needs Democratic Republic of Congo  With hostilities at an end, full support will be given to the rehabilitation of the country. Once the assessment missions to all regions are successfully accomplished, programmes and plans of action for rehabilitation with a focus on health and institutional development will be drawn up and presented to all interested partners for assistance. The operation for the 25,000 refugees from Cabinda will continue, the present support to displaced persons, refugees and vulnerable people will be closely monitored and if necessary expanded. The implementation of the DPP programme will continue. The implementation of all these programmes depends on the presence of the Federation's delegation in Kinshasa. The delegation, and the operation for the Cabindan refugees, need substantial strengthening. Rwanda  In Rwanda housing remains top priority, together with the re-establishment of the RRCS infrastructure. This effort should be linked to visible programmes for the community such as theCBFA programme currently under way. A delegate for this programme has been requested and is urgently needed. A General Assembly is planned for August and financial support to help defray expenses is required. Finally, there is need for a resource development delegate who will help the RRCS in identifying income generating activities. Burundi  The priority of the programme in Burundi is capacity and institutional building of the National Society, non-food assistance to the most vulnerable and social programmes. Outstanding needs will be defined by a high level assessment mission in June. Tanzania  Outstanding needs in Tanzania include the expansion of the camp site at Kasulu to cope with the new influx of Burundian refugees; the installation of a water system and improvement of the distribution site at Lugufu; improvement of sanitation systems; setting up satellite Outpatient Departments and improving health education in both camps. Financial support for TRCS drought intervention efforts is still sought. Congo  In order to implement the plan of action with Congolese Red Cross a relief administrator, logistics delegate and donations for relief/medical items are needed. Conclusion It is still too soon to have a detailed picture of what activities should be implemented in the coming weeks and months. One thing is certain: the scale of needs is such that prolonged support by donor societies will be needed to cope with the effects of the crisis and to contribute to stability in the region.    Ann Naef Acting Head Appeals and Reports Bekele Geleta Director Service Africa Department ","IFRC Great Lakes Situation report No 2 RWANDAN AND BURUNDIAN REFUGEES & RWANDA COUNTRY OPERATIONS Period covered: May 1 - May 20 With the fall of Kinshasa to the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) and the exit of President Mobutu Sese Seko the Great Lakes region has seen a significant political change. The leader of the newly-named Democratic Republic of Congo, Laurent Kabila has banned political activities and demonstrations, in the wake of his decision not to give former Prime Minster Etienne Tshisekedi a post in Cabinet. Elections, a key demand of the UN and many Western nations, will not be held for at least two years. Red Cross activities in the region are stepping up due to the continuing population movements -- at the time of writing some 120,000 refugees managed to escape rebel advances and started to cross into some neighbouring countries.  The context The Red Cross Societies of Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire, with the support of the International Federation, provide assistance to refugees, displaced people, returnees and vulnerable groups who have been placed at risk by conflict, war and disease in much of the Great Lakes region. The operation, and hence the scope of this situation report, has changed radically since the Appeal was drawn up in late 1996. Latest events Democratic Republic of Congo  On Friday 16 May President Mobutu relinquished power and left Kinshasa. The next day Laurent Kabila declared himself President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the new name for the country. The take-over did not trigger the all-out final battle that had been anticipated by some (although over 200 died during and after the fall of Kinshasa), but sparked the movement of a new group of refugees into neighbouring countries. The death of 91 refugees in a crush on an ADFL train from Biaro to Kisangani on May 4 brought condemnation from the Rwandan Government of the UN, which in turn accused the ADFL of overcrowding the wagons. Although humanitarian organisations had difficulties with the numbers arriving at Kisangani, UNHCR managed to reach its target of airlifting 2,000 refugees per day to Rwanda. Access to refugees still hiding in the forest is still sporadic and difficult. Rwanda  Confrontation between ex-Forces Armees Rwandaises/Interahamwe and Government forces persists, especially in the north-east. Attacks on individuals and soft targets (schools, priests) continue. On 11 May six people were killed in Nyakizu -- the first attack in Butare prefecture which up till now had been spared from the violence. Over 45,000 returnees have entered Rwanda by road/rail/air since the new influx started in mid-April. On arrival they are brought to the central transit centre at Runda, are screened, registered and leave for their home villages within 24 hours. Burundi  More than 800 people have been killed recently in the Southern part of the country where fighting between government troops and rebels has intensified. Peace negotiations in Rome are not expected to yield great results. Bujumbura is still calm, although some fighting is ongoing 15 km from the city. The five Northern provinces where the Federation and the Burundi Red Cross operate are calm. Although the economic sanctions imposed on the country in 1996 by the region were softened by the partial lifting of bans on medicine, food, agricultural products, educational and construction material, they still have a strong effect. The problem of internally displaced persons, especially in 'regroupement' camps remains unsolved. The country is also facing a louse-borne typhus epidemic with almost 24,000 cases reported up to 15 May. Tanzania  Western Tanzania still receives the brunt of the fall out from instability in Burundi and Democratic Republic of Congo/former Zaire. Refugee camps along the Burundian border receive a daily average of up to 600 new refugees. Ongoing drought in the Northeast of the country affecting 610,00 people has prompted the government and Action by Churches Together to launch an appeal to assist the stricken population. Congo Approximately 20,000 Rwandan refugees including groups of armed elements crossed the Zaire river in the latter part of May. Most were in a precarious state of health through malnutrition and consumption of polluted water. The Congolese authorities have confirmed their willingness to accept these refugees but want to have the ex-FAR/Interahamwe separated from the other refugees. UNHCR has been asked by the government to repatriate these refugees in the shortest possible time. Red Cross/Red Crescent action Democratic Republic of Congo National Red Cross teams were highly active, supporting refugees wherever they could be reached and more recently removing the dead from the streets in Kinshasa.

148,33609,[4593],Food and Nutrition,Drought relief for Irian Jaya,"AA54 I am pleased to announce a grant of $300 000 to World Vision Australia to provide emergency food relief to villagers in remote parts of Irian Jaya. These funds will enable World Vision to provide food supplies to thousands of people in the most severely affected areas of the Jayawijaya district which borders Papua New Guinea. The relief exercise will start immediately and run over the next two months with foodstuffs being flown into remote villages via the town of Wanema. Over 400 deaths have been reported in the Jayawijaya district since the onset of food and water shortages caused by the extended drought and frost damage to local crops. It is estimated that two-thirds of children in the targeted villages are severely malnourished. Alongside these children, women, sick and old people will be given priority assistance. World Vision has been active in this part of Irian Jaya for over twenty years and is well-placed to implement the emergency relief operation. The grant to World Vision takes up a recommendation of the Australian Health Assistance Team dispatched to Indonesia by AusAID early this month. They were charged with investigating appropriate assistance to Indonesia in the face of the extended drought and consequent fire problems experienced across much of the archipelago.  The grant forms part of the $2million that the Australian Government has made available, through AusAID, for the forest fire and drought emergency in Indonesia.

149,33808,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,WFP Rwanda Weekly Situation Report No. 43/44,"PS / 5-Nov-97 WFP Kigali, BP 1150, Kigali, Rwanda Tel: 250 87611 / 2 /3 / 4 Fax: 250 87621 HIGHLIGHTS WFP distributions amount to more than 9,000 MT in the month of October. Regular convoys resume to western area after killing of driver. WFP emergency assistance in Kibungo 60% completed. WFP prioritise emergency assistance in Gikongoro and Umutara. Relations with Region Sanitaire in Butare are smoothed. Serious shortages of pulses affect distribution levels. Prime Minister of Rwanda warns against food diversion. WFP staff member is arrested in Butare Criteria of vulnerable selections is set for emergency intervention  1,270 Rwandan’s expelled from Tanzania.A. SECURITYB. PROGRAMMING  Since the start of October WFP has delivered in the region of 9,000 MT hitting the monthly requirement target for October. At the end of week 43 (24/10/97) 7,900 MT had already been delivered. Precise information is not yet available for week 44, however distribution levels look to be at around 2,000 MT. The chart below shows how WFP distributions are increasing rapidly in the second half of 1997. This is to coincide with increased needs in the communes.     Seeds protection programmes were completed in all prefectures with the exception of Kibuye (were security restraints prevented delivery). Food For Work activities in Kibuye were visited during the reporting period. All activities appear to be progressing as per schedule but workers are now complaining as they have not received food since September. Workers were encouraged to continue work, and were assured that WFP would do its utmost to ensure delivery of food. New FFW projects will not be approve in Kibuye until it can be assured that we can meet our current commitments. An important meeting was held in Butare regional office to look into the problems related to Tuzamurane shelter project, which was discontinued by WFP last month (where food aid had been sold and cash provided to workers not food rations). The meeting was attended by government and military officials as well as WFP. The meeting concluded that the problems should be resolved through the Prefecture Food Committee which then met the following day. The PFC reinforced WFP’s policy with the following statements. No food aid should be sold by implementing partners. No business people should be allowed to buy food aid. All food aid purchased would be confiscated by the military. The PFC must be informed by WFP of all dispatches to communes. Any civilian, military or local leader involved in food diversion would be arrested. The PFC will introduce a specific delivery note, any truck carrying WFP food without this note will be arrested. Reports have been received from Cyangugu of 270 cases of malnutrition in Busozo Commune. Busozo commune has been recently created and suffers from poor infrastructure in terms of roads, education and health facilities (no nutrition centre). WFP has agreed to intervene in the area in the form of FFW, with the approval for the rehabilitation of 180 klms of rural roads. This will improve access to the commune as well as counter some of the food shortages in the commune. World food day was celebrated in Rutonde commune in Kibungo. The President of the Republic of Rwanda, government Ministers, various diplomatic missions, WFP, FAO, and NGO representatives attended the celebrations. The visitors toured Rwamagana Rice scheme and later attended crop exhibitions by various NGOs and Agricultural Co-operatives. The day was organised by FAO. During World food day, WFP’s Executive Directors statement was broadcast on Rwandan Radio in all official languages of Rwanda. The Prime Minister Mr S. Rwigema together with other Government officials visited Kibungo Prefecture on Wednesday 28/10/97. The aim of the mission was to assess housing resettlement projects as well as food security in the prefecture. WFP continues to support Solidarity camps around the country by providing basic food rations to the participants. Currently the second wave of camps are being conducted for people who returned from camps in Tanzania and DRC, who wish to seek employment. Food prices continue to rise throughout Rwanda. EU market surveys show large increases from September to October with the price of Beans and Maize rising 31% and 39% respectively. However the same scenario is not true with imported food products such as oil, which dropped slightly between the two months and continue to maintain similar prices to 1996 levels. The three charts below show the movements of prices in terms of Beans, Maize and Oil.C. CAMPS / REPATRIATION / RESETTLEMENT  WFP has finally been able to deliver the remaining balance of food to Mudende camp in Gisenyi for an estimated 15,000 refugees. The total number of refugees is still unclear, with some estimates as high as 18,600. UNHCR plan to do a registration during the next food distribution. Mudende was previously managed by COOPI however camp management was handed over to the Rwandan Red Cross at the end of October. The Tanzanian Government continues to expel Rwandan Nationals from northern Tanzania. The majority of these people fled Rwanda in the late 1950s and early 60s and have since established lives in Tanzania. In October 1,270 people were returned, (of which 1,166 were old case load and 114 new case load). What is interesting to note is that the vast majority were women and children with men only making up 193 of the total, women 331 and children 663. Nyagatare transit camp received 378 repatriates during week 44 from Uganda. The transit centre had reported a shortage of Maize, which indicates that the WFP rations are not being respected as all commodities are delivered in line with rations. WFP Kibungo is discussing the issue with the UNHCR and LWF offices in Umutara. Burundian refugees continue to return to Burundi as well as arrive in Rwanda. At Kibangira refugee camp 300 repatriated while 231 came into Rwanda, leaving a camp population of 2,173. In Kigeme there are still 144 refugees while at Musange 336 refugees are supported by WFP.D. NUTRITION  WFP and Region Sanitarire held a meeting in Butare prefecture in order to ensure that clear procedures were established for the delivery and monitoring of food deliveries to supplementary feeding centres. New procedures are to be put in place which will split the prefecture into four districts, each of which will be responsible for co-ordinating and reporting on nutrition centres in their areas. It is hoped in this way that reports will be followed up closer and delays in food deliveries will be prevented while at the same time preventing “double dipping” where centres request food support from different donors. One of the most pressing needs identified during the meeting was the need to improve the level of management in the centres. Food deliveries have been delayed in some cases where the supervisors did not complete reports, preventing WFP food releases. While at the same time records are incorrectly filled and patients not cared for correctly. WFP has already started providing 2 months worth of rations to nutrition centres in Gikongoro and Butare. Six nutrition centres in Gikongoro have already received their rations for November and December last week.E. EMERGENCY NEEDS  The Prime Minister delivered a strong statement on the 28/10/97 warning all people involved in food aid distribution that any misconduct would be punished by the authorities. He also instructed all local authorities to help to ensure that all food aid goes to the most needy in society. This follows a letter written by the US Ambassador to the Prime Minister of Rwanda. Food distributions have started in several communes of Kibungo, following the pre-positioning of over 600 MT of food aid for emergency intervention. This accounts for more than 60% of the requirements sent earlier in the month. At the same time WFP monitors have visited individual sectors so as to ascertain if WFP criteria are being followed and cross check numbers with sector leaders. After the request from the Prefect of Gisenyi to assist 27,000 IDPs, WFP programme assistant visited the sites to assess the numbers of people involved. WFP has prioritised the dispatch of food to these groups, which will commence early next week under military escort. Following the meeting held on the 20/10 a second follow up meeting was called to review the level and type of emergency response WFP would undertake in the month of November. The meeting held on the 28/10/97 in the Ministry of Social Affair’s premises, concluded the following points. 1. No beneficiaries who are included in WFP FFW programmes and seeds protection programmes are to be included in the targeted distributions. 2. The targeting criteria laid out by WFP must be fully respected. 3. A full list of beneficiaries must be available at the distribution sites. 4. In cases of irregularities the distributions will be stopped and the authorities will investigate. 5. Monitoring must investigate how the food was used and what impact was achieved. 6. WFP will provide assistance to the final numbers submitted by the prefectures. 7. Only one months ration will be provided, at current ration scales. 8. Women are actively involved at all levels from the sector distributions up to the planning level in the Prefecture Food Committees. The following figures were presented for assistance to the meeting:  Prefecture Population Requested number % of total Ration MT equivalent   Butare  700,855   258,140   37%   8.9   2,297    Gikongoro  495,000   151,605   31%   8.9   1,349    Gitarama  846,000   138,000   16%   8.9   1,228    Kibuye*  466,000   162,455   35%   8.4   1,365    Kibungo  754,000   153,221   20%   8.9   1,364    Umutare  314,000   95,195   30%   8.9   847    Gisenyi **  887,000   27,000   3%   16   432    TOTAL  4,462,855   985,616   22%    8,882     * IDPs and WFP estimates of vulnerable     ** IDP population - WFP to verify with UNHCR     WFP will now prioritise completing Kibungo distributions, and starting in Gikongoro and Umutara (priorities set by the National Food Committee). Negotiations and planning have already started in Gikongoro so as to commence in the coming week. Food distributions in Kibungo have been stopped temporarily pending distribution reports from the Prefecture Food Committee and the Prefect.F. RESOURCE SITUATION / LOGISTICS  The prevailing insecurity situation in the North and West parts of the country continues to hamper food dispatches to these areas. To redress this problem a convoy schedule has been drawn up for the month of November with the objective of dispatching over 1,700mts of food over one month (eleven convoys) . For this purpose additional Hinos will be deployed from Burundi increasing the current in country working number to eleven ( presently seven ) . The hino fleet will be used solely for the purpose of convoy operations . UNHCR have agreed to provide four to five trucks in the meantime for the additional trucking capacity until the extra Hinos arrive . The profile and terms of reference for a convoy leader who will accompany and direct all truck convoys have been sent to the NFC for identification of a convoy leader / commander who will work under the direction of the UNFSO . The post is viewed as necessary following the recent incident involving a WFP truck ,which resulted in the death of the UCTU driver and total destruction of the truck and food . Preparations are under way to dispatch more than 1,349 mts of emergency food aid to victims of the hungry season in Gikongoro Prefecture. There are sufficient stocks of all commodities except pulses in country to meet the required needs . In country receipts for weeks 43 and 44 amounted to 2,666mts with 2,271mts via the Northern Corridor and 435 mts via the Southern Corridor 90% of which were cereals. Stock balances of all commodities are healthy except pulses . Again for pulses the level of receipts are far below the requirements . The prepositioning of over 1,000 mts of pulses at both Kibungo and Butare EDP’S during the months of August and September has averted a major rupture in the pipeline , and has allowed both Sub Offices to dispatch 100% of requirements up until week 44 , however central stocks are at zero (pulses) thus leading to shortfalls for programmes in the Prefectures of Gitarama, Kigali, Byumba , Gisenyi , Ruhengeri and Kibuye. A new transport contract has been signed with the major carriers in Rwanda , this new contract takes on a different form from previous agreements in that transporters have been asked to dedicate part of their fleet ( especially vehicles ranging from 8 - 15mt capacity ) solely to WFP for secondary transport . Secondary transport rates have also been increased as part of the new agreement . Week 44 was the first week of operations under the new agreement and proved to be quite successful with over 250 mts daily trucking capacity at each Sub Office for secondary distribution.G. GENERAL  US envoy Bill Richardson arrived in Kigali on Monday 27/10 as part of his six nation tour. The envoy held talks with the President and Vice President, particularly in relation to pending Human Rights investigations in DRC. The Prime Minister closed the conference held in Kigali to assess the role of NGOs in Rwanda. The conference was attended by all NGOs working in Rwanda as will as several UN agencies and Government Ministries. Several recommendations were made, such as clearer setting of priorities, increase collaboration with local authorities and improved transparency. ","WFP Rwanda Weekly Situation Report No. 43/44 PS / 5-Nov-97 WFP Kigali, BP 1150, Kigali, Rwanda Tel: 250 87611 / 2 /3 / 4 Fax: 250 87621 HIGHLIGHTS WFP distributions amount to more than 9,000 MT in the month of October. Regular convoys resume to western area after killing of driver. WFP emergency assistance in Kibungo 60% completed. WFP prioritise emergency assistance in Gikongoro and Umutara. Relations with Region Sanitaire in Butare are smoothed. Serious shortages of pulses affect distribution levels. Prime Minister of Rwanda warns against food diversion. WFP staff member is arrested in Butare Criteria of vulnerable selections is set for emergency intervention  1,270 Rwandan’s expelled from Tanzania.A. SECURITYB. PROGRAMMING  Since the start of October WFP has delivered in the region of 9,000 MT hitting the monthly requirement target for October. At the end of week 43 (24/10/97) 7,900 MT had already been delivered. Precise information is not yet available for week 44, however distribution levels look to be at around 2,000 MT. The chart below shows how WFP distributions are increasing rapidly in the second half of 1997. This is to coincide with increased needs in the communes.     Seeds protection programmes were completed in all prefectures with the exception of Kibuye (were security restraints prevented delivery). Food For Work activities in Kibuye were visited during the reporting period. All activities appear to be progressing as per schedule but workers are now complaining as they have not received food since September. Workers were encouraged to continue work, and were assured that WFP would do its utmost to ensure delivery of food. New FFW projects will not be approve in Kibuye until it can be assured that we can meet our current commitments. An important meeting was held in Butare regional office to look into the problems related to Tuzamurane shelter project, which was discontinued by WFP last month (where food aid had been sold and cash provided to workers not food rations). The meeting was attended by government and military officials as well as WFP. The meeting concluded that the problems should be resolved through the Prefecture Food Committee which then met the following day. The PFC reinforced WFP’s policy with the following statements. No food aid should be sold by implementing partners. No business people should be allowed to buy food aid. All food aid purchased would be confiscated by the military. The PFC must be informed by WFP of all dispatches to communes. Any civilian, military or local leader involved in food diversion would be arrested. The PFC will introduce a specific delivery note, any truck carrying WFP food without this note will be arrested. Reports have been received from Cyangugu of 270 cases of malnutrition in Busozo Commune. Busozo commune has been recently created and suffers from poor infrastructure in terms of roads, education and health facilities (no nutrition centre). WFP has agreed to intervene in the area in the form of FFW, with the approval for the rehabilitation of 180 klms of rural roads. This will improve access to the commune as well as counter some of the food shortages in the commune. World food day was celebrated in Rutonde commune in Kibungo. The President of the Republic of Rwanda, government Ministers, various diplomatic missions, WFP, FAO, and NGO representatives attended the celebrations. The visitors toured Rwamagana Rice scheme and later attended crop exhibitions by various NGOs and Agricultural Co-operatives. The day was organised by FAO. During World food day, WFP’s Executive Directors statement was broadcast on Rwandan Radio in all official languages of Rwanda. The Prime Minister Mr S.

150,34225,[4589],Contributions,Ethiopia Floods Situation Report No. 2,"DHAGVA - 97/0857 INTERNATIONAL APPEAL SITUATION 1. On 19 November 1997, the head of the Ethiopian Somali National Regional State, Mr. Mohammed Mealin, reported that a total of 297 people have lost their lives as a result of extensive flooding in the region over the past three to four weeks. This follows unseasonal heavy rain in the highlands of Ethiopia in October/early November and the widespread inundation of the lower reaches of the Shebelle, Ganale (Juba in Somalia), and Dawa rivers. In addition to the cost in human lives, more than 12,000 domestic animals were reported lost, some 30,000 hectares of cropland inundated and 4,252 homes destroyed. Among the settled farming communities located along these rivers, approximately 65,000 people have been displaced or have lost livestock and property and remain in need of urgent relief assistance.  2. Immediately following the occurrence of the flooding the Government took steps to assess the extent of the damage while at the same time dispatching emergency relief supplies. With a number of villages along these rivers cut off, an air-relief operation was mounted with a Hercules aircraft hired from Ethiopian Airlines used to pre-position supplies in the central Ogaden town of Gode while an airforce helicopter was deployed to shuttle supplies to affected communities around Kelafo, Mustahil and Ferfer and to rescue people trapped by the rising water levels. Operations are being coordinated in the field by an emergency task force in Gode comprising representatives of the local administration, military, Red Cross and the Government's Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission (DPPC).  3. Using its own resources, supplemented by supplies provided by the Ethiopian Red Cross, the DPPC has transported 35 tons of relief grain, 20 tons of high energy biscuits, 80 rolls of plastic sheeting and some 37,000 litres of fuel to the main operations base at Gode; while some 40 tons of grain, 15 tons of biscuits and 35 rolls of plastic sheeting have been dispatched by truck to meet the immediate needs of people displaced by the flooding of the Ganale and Dawa rivers close to the Ethiopian/Somali/Kenyan border. However, with roads in this area still cut, it is reported that access is only possible by air to the border town of Dolo, where to 8,000 refugees and displaced people are located. 4. Working closely with partners in the Somali region, the ICRC reports that it plans to distribute 10,000 blankets, 5,000 jerrycans, 40,000 square meters of plastic sheeting to around 25,000 people in the next few days. Some medical supplies are also available but will remain in store until adequate supervision structures are established as part of the medical task force soon to be established by the local health bureau.  5. Flooding has also been reported along other major rivers in Ethiopia. The Awash river in the east overflowed its lower reaches a few weeks ago while the Baro and Akobo rivers in the west have also been running very high, threatening a number of low-lying communities in the Gambella region. In both locations, the government has taken measures to pre-position relief food and shelter materials. 6. On 20 November 1997, the DPPC has stated that while the Government has so far managed to meet the most immediate relief needs in the areas affected by the recent floods, a shortage of medium/heavy lift helicopters, shelter materials, medical supplies and supplementary foods has become a matter of concern. With fears that a continuation of the unusually heavy rains over the coming weeks could lead to further flooding in the periphery of the country, external assistance is now required in order that the Government can be in a position to respond effectively. The DPPC has therefore called upon international and local donors to provide support to the on-going flood disaster mitigation and recovery efforts of the Government. CONTRIBUTIONS 7. DHA is making preparations for airlift of relief supplies donated by the Italian Government (tools, plastic sheeting and tents) from DHA Pisa Warehouse. Airlift will include Health Kits donated by the Italian Government through WHO. Value of airlift estimated at USD 230,000 excluding air transport within Ethiopia. 8. The United States Embassy is considering the immediate release of USD 25,000 from the Ambassador's discretionary fund to help defray the logistical support costs of current relief operations. 9. DHA is serving as a channel for cash contributions to be used during the immediate relief phase. Funds are spent in coordination with relevant organizations of the UN system, and DHA provides donor Governments with written confirmation on the utilization of funds contributed. 10. Donors wishing to channel their contributions through DHA - Geneva can transfer funds to DHA account no. CO.590.160.1 at the Swiss Bank Corporation, Case Postale 2770, CH- 1211 Geneva 2, Switzerland, with reference:  Ethiopia Floods. 11. For coordination purposes, donors are requested to inform DHA Geneva, as indicated below, of bilateral relief missions/ pledges/ contributions and their corresponding values by item.

On 19 November 1997, the head of the Ethiopian Somali National Regional State, Mr. Mohammed Mealin, reported that a total of 297 people have lost their lives as a result of extensive flooding in the region over the past three to four weeks. This follows unseasonal heavy rain in the highlands of Ethiopia in October/early November and the widespread inundation of the lower reaches of the Shebelle, Ganale (Juba in Somalia), and Dawa rivers. In addition to the cost in human lives, more than 12,000 domestic animals were reported lost, some 30,000 hectares of cropland inundated and 4,252 homes destroyed. Among the settled farming communities located along these rivers, approximately 65,000 people have been displaced or have lost livestock and property and remain in need of urgent relief assistance.  2. Immediately following the occurrence of the flooding the Government took steps to assess the extent of the damage while at the same time dispatching emergency relief supplies. With a number of villages along these rivers cut off, an air-relief operation was mounted with a Hercules aircraft hired from Ethiopian Airlines used to pre-position supplies in the central Ogaden town of Gode while an airforce helicopter was deployed to shuttle supplies to affected communities around Kelafo, Mustahil and Ferfer and to rescue people trapped by the rising water levels. Operations are being coordinated in the field by an emergency task force in Gode comprising representatives of the local administration, military, Red Cross and the Government's Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission (DPPC).  3. Using its own resources, supplemented by supplies provided by the Ethiopian Red Cross, the DPPC has transported 35 tons of relief grain, 20 tons of high energy biscuits, 80 rolls of plastic sheeting and some 37,000 litres of fuel to the main operations base at Gode; while some 40 tons of grain, 15 tons of biscuits and 35 rolls of plastic sheeting have been dispatched by truck to meet the immediate needs of people displaced by the flooding of the Ganale and Dawa rivers close to the Ethiopian/Somali/Kenyan border. However, with roads in this area still cut, it is reported that access is only possible by air to the border town of Dolo, where to 8,000 refugees and displaced people are located. 4. Working closely with partners in the Somali region, the ICRC reports that it plans to distribute 10,000 blankets, 5,000 jerrycans, 40,000 square meters of plastic sheeting to around 25,000 people in the next few days. Some medical supplies are also available but will remain in store until adequate supervision structures are established as part of the medical task force soon to be established by the local health bureau.  5. Flooding has also been reported along other major rivers in Ethiopia. The Awash river in the east overflowed its lower reaches a few weeks ago while the Baro and Akobo rivers in the west have also been running very high, threatening a number of low-lying communities in the Gambella region. In both locations, the government has taken measures to pre-position relief food and shelter materials. 6. On 20 November 1997, the DPPC has stated that while the Government has so far managed to meet the most immediate relief needs in the areas affected by the recent floods, a shortage of medium/heavy lift helicopters, shelter materials, medical supplies and supplementary foods has become a matter of concern. With fears that a continuation of the unusually heavy rains over the coming weeks could lead to further flooding in the periphery of the country, external assistance is now required in order that the Government can be in a position to respond effectively. The DPPC has therefore called upon international and local donors to provide support to the on-going flood disaster mitigation and recovery efforts of the Government. CONTRIBUTIONS 7. DHA is making preparations for airlift of relief supplies donated by the Italian Government (tools, plastic sheeting and tents) from DHA Pisa Warehouse. Airlift will include Health Kits donated by the Italian Government through WHO. Value of airlift estimated at USD 230,000 excluding air transport within Ethiopia. 8. The United States Embassy is considering the immediate release of USD 25,000 from the Ambassador's discretionary fund to help defray the logistical support costs of current relief operations. 9. DHA is serving as a channel for cash contributions to be used during the immediate relief phase. Funds are spent in coordination with relevant organizations of the UN system, and DHA provides donor Governments with written confirmation on the utilization of funds contributed. 10. Donors wishing to channel their contributions through DHA - Geneva can transfer funds to DHA account no. CO.590.160.1 at the Swiss Bank Corporation, Case Postale 2770, CH- 1211 Geneva 2, Switzerland, with reference:  Ethiopia Floods. 11. For coordination purposes, donors are requested to inform DHA Geneva, as indicated below, of bilateral relief missions/ pledges/ contributions and their corresponding values by item.

153,34613,[12033],Mine Action,IRIN background brief on landmines in Central and Eastern Africa,"UNITED NATIONS Department of Humanitarian Affairs Integrated Regional Information Network for the Great Lakes Tel: +254 2 622147 Fax: +254 2 622129 e-mail: irin@dha.unon.org [This brief is intended as background information for the humanitarian community and does not necessarily reflect the views of the UN] 6 December 1997 The signature by 125 countries of the Ottawa Treaty is an historic step towards the adoption in international law of a total world ban on anti-personnel landmines. The total ban would cover use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. In Africa, the majority of countries, 37 in all, have backed this initiative and signed on Wednesday and Thursday (3 and 4 December) the Ottawa Treaty. Among the signatories are Angola, Burundi, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Sudan and Tanzania. South Africa, the most important African manufacturer of landmines, also signed the treaty. After Asia, Africa is the second most-affected continent with Angola remaining one of the most heavily-mined countries in the world. Regional experts stress, however, that even if the use of landmines in the conflicts of the Great Lakes region is currently neither very widespread nor a major factor, the increasing use of mines in these regional disputes is undoubtedly a growing cause for concern. The current situation country-by-country in Central and Eastern Africa is as follows: ANGOLA: ICRC estimate between 10 and 20 million landmines have been laid across Angola. During the civil war which preceded and followed independence in 1975, both the MPLA and UNITA made widescale use of landmines in military operations. But these were condcuted in a disorganised manner with no registration of their location. Consequently, the country is littered with mines. This humanitarian crisis has led to the death of several thousand people, and mutilated some 30,000 others. It has also cut off access to fields and even sources of drinking water for hundreds of thousands of others. Several international organisations have set up important demining operations, such as the NGO HALO, but have also set up victim-support groups and population-awareness programmes. Currently, Angola is witnessing another period of tension and a recent report by the UN mission in the country, quoted by AFP, accused former UNITA rebels of remining certain roads in the north and north-east of the country. BURUNDI: Since October 1966, incidents linked to mines have increased and now stand at 49. Even if the figure is not particularly significant, it is the upward trend that is worrying, according to Michel Sidibe, UNICEF representative in Burundi. Landmines laid in Burundi are most often anti-tank mines, placed on busy roads and even the streets of the capital Bujumbura. However, no independent and complete assessment of the situation has been undertaken because of insecurity in large parts of the country leading to fears the real number of landmines laid nationwide could in fact be much higher. CONGO-BRAZZAVILLE: Unconfirmed reports suggest that certain areas were mined during recent clashes between supporters of former president Pascal Lissouba and those of current President Denis Sassou Nguesso. Congo-Brazzaville supports a world ban on landmines, but has not signed the Ottawa Treaty. UGANDA: In a similar fashion to Burundi, landmines are used in Uganda by rebel groups and are often left on roads in the north and northwest regions of the country, most notably around Gulu and Kitgum and, to a lesser extent, around Bundibugyo and Western Nile. According to ICRC, three-quarters of the victims of landmines in northern Uganda are children. According to an official communique published in April 1997, Uganda has completed ceased landmine production. DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO: DRC is a country which is relatively free of landmines. However, during the recent war between the forces of President Laurent-Desire Kabila and the Zairean army of former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, mercenary troops called in by Mobutu are reported to have laid mines around Kisangani. An international NGO has also reported the presence of some landmines around Ubundu. Currently, however, there is no precise account of the national situation. RWANDA: Rwanda has been faced with the problem of landmines since 1990, but the situation worsened dramatically in 1994 when the then-government army, the Forces Armees Rwandaises (FAR), laid mines in several towns and regions during their retreat. Other sources say the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) has also laid mines. ICRC estimate that there are currently 250,000 mines in Rwanda. Several incidents have also been reported in the border prefectures with former Zaire between 1994 and 1996, suggesting that infiltrators from refugee camps in eastern DRC were responsible. Several demining programmes have been set up, including one organised by the US defence department to train units of the current Rwandan army. SUDAN: ICRC estimates that more than one million mines have been laid in Sudan. Humanitarian sources say the outskirts of the southern capital of Juba and other southern towns held by government troops are ringed by heavy minefields. The use of mines in the country, however, appears to be limited geographically to frontline areas between government and rebel SPLA forces. However, the frontier areas, most notably Wadi Halfa which is contested by Egypt, are also likely to have been mined, according to experts.

154,34745,[4589],Contributions,Ethiopia Floods Situation Report No. 3,"DHAGVA - 97/0870 Updates on the Appeal for International Assistance Situation Updates: 1. Unseasonable heavy rains in the highlands of Ethiopia in October-November have led to extensive flooding in the lower reaches of the Shebelle, Ganale (Juba in Somalia), and Dawa rivers, killing 297 people and affecting 80,000 families in the Somali region, of which 16,000 families were made homeless or destitute.  2. Flooding has also occurred in other vulnerable areas of the country. According to the Ethiopian Government's Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission (DPPC), localized inundation of the Awash river basin has displaced some 7,500 families around Melka Werer and Gewane, while in the Hadiya zone flash floods reportedly killed 20 people and led to the displacement of some 47,000. In the west of the country, the Baro and Akobo rivers have also been running very high, threatening a number of low-lying communities in the Gambella region.  National Response: 3. The Ethiopian Government is active in providing necessary relief assistance to the affected areas. It has organized an airlift of relief goods from Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa, while helicopters were deployed to rescue people stranded and to shuttle supplies to villages cut-off when the Shebelle, Ganale and Dawa rivers broke their banks. In the affected locations along the Awash river and in the Gambella region, the Government has taken measures to pre-position relief food and shelter materials. 4. Fearing that continued heavy rain in the highlands would lead to further flooding and with a number of the affected areas still inaccessible by road, DPPC appealed to the international community for additional logistical assistance, shelter materials, food, and medicines (Refer to DHA Situation Report no. 2 dated 21 November).  International Response: 5. The Appeal has met with a favorable response, including a commitment of USD 50,000 from the Organisation of African Unity, a cash contribution of USD 25,000 from the United States Government for supporting relief and rehabilitation actions, and USD 158,000 in re-phased emergency funds from UNDP for meeting part of the costs of mounting the airlift operation. Furthermore, the German Government is providing bilaterally DM 20,000 (USD 11,430) to procure medicines, blankets, and household items.  6. With the financial support of the Italian Government, DHA, in cooperation with WHO, organized an airlift of 25 tons of relief goods from its Pisa Warehouse, including non-food items and WHO medical kits (valued at USD 274,000, including the transport cost). The relief goods arrived in Addis Ababa on 2 December and were further transported to the DPPC operations center in Gode on 5 December.  7. Following the recent floods, WHO has recruited a consultant to work in the affected regions for five weeks and support the development of emergency plans. A particular concern at present is the threat posed by possible outbreaks of malaria and cholera in the aftermath of the floods, especially in the densely populated areas along the Shebelle and Ganale rivers.  Relief Operation: 8. Throughout the last week of November, the logistics operation was greatly enhanced following the French Government's decision to deploy two medium-lift Puma helicopters and a C-160 Transall transport aircraft from its military base in Djibouti. DPPC also chartered a JetRanger helicopter from Helimission (NGO). The Ethiopian Ministry of Defense made available 6 motorised boats for the Gode area and one additional heavy-lift helicopter for operations along the Dawa and Ganale rivers in Liban zone where damage to the road network had led to the isolation of numerous villages, including the border town of Dolo where upwards of 8,000 refugees and displaced people are encamped. With this additional logistics capacity, by the end of November DPPC had been able to pre-position and distribute a total of 310 tons of relief grain, 45 tons of high energy biscuits and 115 rolls of plastic sheeting. 9. Working closely with the emergency task force established by the regional and military authorities in Gode, ICRC is presently undertaking the distribution of 10,000 blankets, 5,000 cooking pots, 5,000 jerrycans, and 80,000 square metres of plastic sheeting to about 25,000 people. Some medical supplies have also been pre-positioned but will remain in store until adequate supervision structures are established as part of the medical task force soon to be established by the local health bureau. In addition, with a view to the longer-term rehabilitation needs of the affected population, on 24/25 November ICRC, together with the Ethiopian Red Cross, transported sufficient veterinary medicines for the treatment of around 430,000 camels, cattle, sheep and goats.  Unmet/Further Assistance Needs: 10. With a return to more normal weather conditions in the Ethiopian highlands and a fall in river levels, the immediate danger of further flooding in the periphery of the country can be expected to diminish somewhat.  11. To meet the most urgent needs in cases of further sudden flooding in vulnerable areas, the Government is appealing for 150 water bladders, 10 water purification plants, some 1,920 rolls of plastic sheeting, 400 family tents, motorized inflatable rubber boats, walkie-talkies, and other miscellaneous shelter materials. In addition, a requirement for 2,700 tons of high energy biscuits has also been identified. 12. Given that farmers may have lost their seed stocks, the Government is planning the provision of seeds. A number of agencies, including local NGOs, are presently assessing the needs and are considering assistance with seeds and tools. This includes ICRC which, together with the Ethiopian Red Cross, is presently planning to purchase certified seeds for some 50,000 farmers in the Somali region. Distribution in the affected areas, however, will depend on the reopening of access roads. 13. The Government is also currently assessing rehabilitation needs in the agricultural sector and contingency needs for pre-positioning drugs (malaria and cholera) in the flood-prone areas. 14. On 28 November, DPPC launched its relief appeal for 1998, indicating that some 4.2 million people would be in need of more than half a million tons of food assistance for a period of up to 12 months. This appeal, though separate from the flood-related Appeal issued through DHA, aims to address the food security needs of the country, on which the recent floods have made a negative impact.  Channel for Contributions: 15. DHA is prepared to serve as a channel for cash contributions, to be used during the immediate relief phase, in coordination/consultation with relevant organizations of the United Nations system. DHA provides donors with written confirmation and pertinent details concerning the utilization of the funds contributed. Donors wishing to channel their contributions through DHA should transfer funds to DHA account no. CO.590.160.1 at the Swiss Bank Corporation, Case Postale 2770, CH-1211 Geneva 2, Switzerland, with reference: Ethiopia - Floods. 16. For coordination purposes, donors are requested to inform DHA Geneva, as indicated below, of relief missions, pledges or contributions and their corresponding values by item.

In addition, with a view to the longer-term rehabilitation needs of the affected population, on 24/25 November ICRC, together with the Ethiopian Red Cross, transported sufficient veterinary medicines for the treatment of around 430,000 camels, cattle, sheep and goats.  Unmet/Further Assistance Needs: 10. With a return to more normal weather conditions in the Ethiopian highlands and a fall in river levels, the immediate danger of further flooding in the periphery of the country can be expected to diminish somewhat.  11. To meet the most urgent needs in cases of further sudden flooding in vulnerable areas, the Government is appealing for 150 water bladders, 10 water purification plants, some 1,920 rolls of plastic sheeting, 400 family tents, motorized inflatable rubber boats, walkie-talkies, and other miscellaneous shelter materials. In addition, a requirement for 2,700 tons of high energy biscuits has also been identified. 12. Given that farmers may have lost their seed stocks, the Government is planning the provision of seeds. A number of agencies, including local NGOs, are presently assessing the needs and are considering assistance with seeds and tools. This includes ICRC which, together with the Ethiopian Red Cross, is presently planning to purchase certified seeds for some 50,000 farmers in the Somali region. Distribution in the affected areas, however, will depend on the reopening of access roads. 13. The Government is also currently assessing rehabilitation needs in the agricultural sector and contingency needs for pre-positioning drugs (malaria and cholera) in the flood-prone areas. 14. On 28 November, DPPC launched its relief appeal for 1998, indicating that some 4.2 million people would be in need of more than half a million tons of food assistance for a period of up to 12 months. This appeal, though separate from the flood-related Appeal issued through DHA, aims to address the food security needs of the country, on which the recent floods have made a negative impact.  Channel for Contributions: 15. DHA is prepared to serve as a channel for cash contributions, to be used during the immediate relief phase, in coordination/consultation with relevant organizations of the United Nations system. DHA provides donors with written confirmation and pertinent details concerning the utilization of the funds contributed. Donors wishing to channel their contributions through DHA should transfer funds to DHA account no. CO.590.160.1 at the Swiss Bank Corporation, Case Postale 2770, CH-1211 Geneva 2, Switzerland, with reference: Ethiopia - Floods. 16.

156,35133,[4589],Contributions,Somalia Floods Situation Report No. 11,"FLASH APPEAL for the JANUARY-JUNE 1998 PERIOD Ref: DHAGVA - 97/0878 BACKGROUND AND CURRENT SITUATION 1. The rolling flood emergency that affected southern Somalia since the end of October 1997 is far from over. While some emergency food has been delivered, severe food shortages will remain at least for the next three months. In many areas water levels remain high. In some parts of the country water and river levels had already been decreasing, but following heavy new rains in neighboring Ethiopia and Kenya, water levels rose again. They often do not allow displaced people to return to their villages or towns of origin yet. Many roads remain blocked and access to markets/supplies is still difficult if not impossible for many people. The health situation in the flood affected areas continues to be serious and worrying. The sanitation systems in most affected villages and towns has broken down completely putting the local population increasingly at risk of cholera. In some places, for example raw sewage flows through the areas where people are settled. The water is also an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes and thus for malaria. Due to these poor health conditions, most of the deaths reported these days result from diseases such as malaria, diarrhea or respiratory infections.    Number of deaths: 1830 (total confirmed)  Number of displaced people: 230,000  People remaining at risk: 1 Million approximately  Livestock reported killed: 33,000 at least Food stock destroyed: more than 60,000 hectares of crops and farm land destroyed. Loss of ""Gu"" crops kept in traditional underground granaries is estimated at 31,100 metric tons. The January harvest is estimated to be reduced by at least 35,000 metric tons from the initial projection of 95,000 metric tons. RESPONSE TO NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 1997 FLASH APPEAL: EMERGENCY RESCUE AND RELIEF 2. The Somalia Inter-Agency Flood Response Team started its operations in early November. Through the office of the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Somalia, a Flash Appeal was issued for USD 13 million to start relief operations. This amount was to cover emergency rescue and relief until the end of December 1997, as follows: Emergency Supplies    (food and non-food items): USD 4,6 M  Logistics: USD 5,0 M  Helicopter Operation (for 8 helicopters): USD 3,4 M  TOTAL: USD 13,0 M  Donor response was swift and generous. To date USD 11,589,000 have been either received or pledged, covering 89 percent of the requirements. 3. UNICEF    Donations received in kind (equivalent to): USD 1,750,000  Cash donations already received or formally pledged: USD 1,625,000  TOTAL USD 3,375,000  Expenditures up to 16.12.97 USD 3,285,000  Cash donations confirmed but not yet received: USD 1,477,000  Pledges to be confirmed: USD  300,000  Donations for helicopters operation USD 1,086,000 4.

FAO Agricultural Inputs: FAO has provided agricultural inputs consisting of seeds and tools for a value of USD 400,000, targeting 20,000 farming families. The up coming 'GU' season, starting in April 1998 will be very important and assessments are underway to prepare for the necessary inputs. 8. Up to 21.12.97, the Inter Agency Flood Response Team, has been able to provide the following emergency relief items into the flood stricken areas: Food: 2,243.5 metric tons benefitting 319,490 people (Lower/Middle Juba, Gedo, Bay and Lower Shabelle). Shelter: 152,100 people assisted with tarpaulins/shelter material. Blankets: 56,313 families. Jerrycans: 31,866 families. Supermix: 80,000 children assisted. BP-5 biscuits  12,986 cartons supplied to 24,000 families. Biscuits: 9,500 cartons distributed to 9,500 families. Sand bags: 120,000 supplied for flood prevention and road repairs. Daily rations: 50,000 distributed by airdrops. Kits: 1,500 resettlement kits. Health kits: 190 kits and 300 cartons of ORS. Other items distributed included mosquito nets, water tanks, chlorine. Distribution of supplies had started in November, the 2 helicopters started operating on 6 December from Garissa, since 10 December a proper airdrop operation has backed up the distribution system. Life-saving rescue and supply operations have been carried out by boats, donkey carts, manpower and trucks (where possible) since early November. At present 21 boats are involved in the operation. Management of the operation has been shared, with UNICEF as overall coordinator of operations, and WFP managing the logistic centers. Assessments were conducted by the Food Security Assessment Unit (FSAU), the Famine Early Warning System (FEWS/Somalia) and the United Nations Development Office for Somalia (UNDOS). The analysis, the planning, the budgeting, the field relief response, and monitoring were undertaken by the Inter-agency Flood Response partners comprising UN agencies, INGOs, and local NGOs. RESPONSE PLANNED AND FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR JANUARY - JUNE 1998: Total amount needed:    USD 12,763,009. The weather pattern with general bad atmospheric conditions is expected to continue until April 1998, causing unseasonal rains and floods. From January to March, emphasis will remain on 'Continued Relief' and 'Relief and Rehabilitation'. Hopefully, in the final stage from April to June, the emphasis will be moved to a phase 'From Relief to Rehabilitation'. The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator will coordinate the Inter-Agency Flood Response under which individual UN Agencies and NGOs carry out their mandated activities. The now urgently required food assistance will be implemented by WFP, UNICEF is appealing for non-food assistance. REQUIREMENTS 9.

159,35439,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Brazzaville Assessment Report," United States Agency for International Development Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance  Team Members    Mikaela Meredith Alden Henderson, Ph.D., MPH Scott Lillibridge, M.D. Royce Shearing   Team Leader, Program Officer Water/Sanitation Consultant Health Consultant Logistics/Communications Consultant   I. Executive Summary On June 5, 1997, fighting erupted in Brazzaville when forces loyal to President Pascal Lissouba surrounded the residence of former president Denis Sassou Nguesso in an attempt to crack down on private militias prior to the presidential election scheduled for July 27. Despite regional and international mediation, both sides failed to reach agreement on the formation of a transitional government and the rescheduling of elections. Fighting intensified until October 14, when the conflict ended with a military victory by Sassou Nguesso. Five months of conflict have displaced large populations from the capital city of Brazzaville. More than 40,000 Congolese crossed the river and sought refuge in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DROC). Constant bombardment and shelling in Brazzaville destroyed the business district and left the economy in ruins. Structures that survived the war were completely stripped and looted. An estimated 20% of houses in the residential districts were damaged. The water system was damaged; access to potable water has been substantially reduced. Many of the city’s health centers were destroyed and looted. Food is in limited supply and prices have soared 25% to 300%. There is an ever-growing sanitation problem due to the clogging of the drainage system by the lack of maintenance and debris. Main port facilities and airport terminal buildings were destroyed. In response to a request for assistance from the Government of the Republic of the Congo (ROC), on October 27, U.S. Ambassador Aubrey Hooks declared a disaster situation, thus enabling USAID to respond. On November 4, USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Response’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (BHR/OFDA) deployed a four person team to assess and report on the conditions of the affected populations in Brazzaville and recommend options for the United States Government (USG). The assessment team was based in Kinshasa, DROC, and made day trips into Brazzaville, ROC. The team’s assessment was limited by lack of logistical support, security, and the U.S. Embassy/Kinshasa’s refusal to allow the team to stay overnight in Brazzaville. However, the team was able to conduct field assessments in Brazzaville, meet with representatives from UN agencies, ICRC and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) operating in the ROC, and participate in coordination meetings. The team departed Kinshasa on November 18, 1997. Based on its findings, the team concluded: 1. Displaced Populations. Of a total estimated pre-war population of 2.6 million in the ROC, between 800,000 and one million people lived in Brazzaville before the war. The current population of Brazzaville is estimated at 200,000, with between 100 and 1,000 people returning per week. Between 500,000 and 600,000 people are displaced north and south of the city. NGOs have been unable to assess the numbers and needs of displaced people in the corridor between Pointe Noire and Brazzaville. An estimated 5,000 people died in the conflict. 2. Water. There is no acute shortage of drinking water in the city even though the water treatment plant that provides water to the northern part of the city (about 40% of the pre-war population) is not operating. To accommodate for the loss of production, water from the other water treatment plant is being pumped to the northern parts of the city. People have adapted to the decreased supply by digging wells, collecting rain water, walking to nearby water sources, and conserving water. In addition, the city’s water consumption has been reduced because 80% of the residents fled the city during the war and have not returned. Although there is an adequate amount of water, contamination could occur. The operating water treatment plant does not effectively treat the water, people are digging shallow wells in areas close to pit latrines, chlorine is not available to disinfect collected water, and breaks in the water pipes and decreased water pressure can introduce contamination to the system. Shortages could occur if the population increases rapidly, if the only operating water treatment plant breaks down, or if the Djiri water treatment plant cannot be made operational soon. 3. Health. International relief organizations are working in and rehabilitating two hospitals in Brazzaville. Emergency public health and clinical services require emergency restoration, essential medications, and the assurance of potable water to serve the growing population of Brazzaville. Limited emergency outpatient services are available. Cases of typhoid and cholera were reported in mid-November among residents in Brazzaville. 4. Shelter. More than 5,000 homes are completely destroyed and 45,000 homes are damaged. There is a need for emergency repairs to houses in order to protect occupants during the rainy season, which will last until May. 5. Sanitation. Debris from the war, garbage, and trash that has accumulated has clogged drainage canals and caused pooling of water and flooding in low lying areas. 6. Food. While only a few cases of malnutrition were reported in Brazzaville, the nutritional status of the affected population may deteriorate as more people return to the city and sufficient food is not available. Host families in rural areas are strained by the added food needs for displaced populations and many farmers have been forced to consume their seeds. 7. Refugees. An estimated 39,600 Congolese sought refuge across the river in the DROC. Of this total, 11,000 refugees live in the UNHCR-assisted Kinkole refugee camp; the remainder reside with host families in Kinshasa and receive food assistance at Kinkole camp once a week. The ROC hosts between 11,000 and 12,000 Rwandan refugees. 8. Logistics. The logistics situation in Brazzaville is improving and the transportation of supplies into Brazzaville has started. The airport is open and 76 tons of relief supplies were airlifted into Brazzaville on November 12. Ferries between Kinshasa and Brazzaville are fully operational and are running a total of 10 round trips per day. There is still a critical shortage of vehicles. 9. Security. Security is improving in Brazzaville. Many relief agencies have established permanent offices staffed by expatriates. There have been no reports of security incidents involving humanitarian workers. Relief workers are able to move freely around the city. An estimated 2,000 Cobra militia were disarmed. On November 1, the UN reduced the security level from 5 to 4 in Brazzaville. Limited looting continues throughout the city. 10. Coordination. Coordination among relief agencies operating in Brazzaville is good. UN agencies are responsible for coordinating emergency needs in each sector. A UN Inter-Agency Consolidated Appeal for the ROC issued on November 10 requested $17.7 million to address emergency requirements from November 1997 to January 1998. The host government is neither facilitating nor hindering the delivery of assistance. ECHO is the major donor. II. Displaced Populations Of a pre-war population of 2.6 million in the ROC, between 800,000 and one million people lived in the capital city Brazzaville before the war. Due to fighting in and around Brazzaville for five months, between 500,000 and 600,000 people left the city. A breakdown of the displaced population includes: 200,000 people in Pointe Noire; 100,000 people between Brazzaville and Kinkala; 100,000 people north of Brazzaville as far as Impfondo; 60,000 people in the triangle formed by Nkayi, Sibiti, and Dolisie; and 50,000 people between Pointe Noire and Brazzaville. According to UNICEF, 65% of the displaced population are women and children. The current population of Brazzaville is estimated at 200,000 and there are an estimated 200,000 people who are unaccounted for. Since the war, between 100 to 1,000 people per week have been returning to Brazzaville. The UN reports that 10% of the residents of Poto-Poto have returned to date and between 40% to 50% have returned to the residential areas in northern Brazzaville. The host government has asked civil servants to return to the capital. Many returnees, upon finding their homes and places of employment destroyed, return immediately to the countryside. As a result there is a constant flow of people entering and exiting the city. Due to the present uncertainty regarding the political and economic situation and damage to the infrastructure in Brazzaville, the UN estimates that 70% of the displaced population (not including refugees) will return to Brazzaville before the end of the year. Other sources speculate that most internally displaced persons (IDPs) will not return to Brazzaville until basic services become operational. In Brazzaville, the displaced live with host families or in public buildings, where basic services are often unavailable. In rural areas, the displaced population exceeds the size of the residential population by as much as four times and strains their limited resources. Relief workers anticipate that displaced people may decide to resettle in their new locations and not return to Brazzaville. This is particularly true of those who fled to Pointe Noire, where the population is less dense and employment opportunities more available. Relief workers are concerned about the condition of the displaced population in the corridor between Pointe Noire and Brazzaville, where due to insecurity, NGOs have not been able to assess the numbers and conditions of the affected populations. III. Water Pre-war Conditions. The National Society for the Distribution of Drinking Water (SNDE) is responsible for the production and distribution of potable water in the ROC. In Brazzaville, they operate the Djoue and Djiri water treatment plants which are named after the rivers from which they obtain their water. The Djoue water treatment plant was built in 1956 and is in the Makelekele sector of the city. The plant has the capacity to pump water at 1500 cubic meters per hour. It is in poor mechanical condition and could break down at any time. The Djiri water treatment plant was built in 1986 and is 12 km north of the city center. It can potentially pump water at 2250 cubic meters per hour to the northern part of the city. Several problems plagued these water treatment plants prior to the war. The distribution system leaked 20% to 45% of the water, electric pumps often broke down, and electric power to the Djiri plant was sporadic. Residents served by these water treatment plants said that they usually do not have water pressure during the afternoon. A map of the water distribution system shows that 20% of the buildings in Brazzaville do not have access to a nearby public water tap. These include residences south of Makelekele, north of the Plateau section of the city, and in the districts of Talangai and Moungali. People living near a river or people who do not have access to city water may have a private well. The quality of water can be good if it comes from a well dug into a sandy river bank and is at least 50 feet from a pit latrine. (The water table in the southern part of Brazzaville is about 10 to 15 meters below the surface and the water table in the northern part ranges from 80 to 150 meters below the surface.) People living in the Plateau section do not have wells due to a low water table, but catch rain during the wet season (October to May). Water is trucked in during the dry season. People also buy water in half-liter plastic bags. Although the water treatment plants were not damaged by the war, the production of water has dropped 80%. The Djoue plant is partially operational and the Djiri plant does not have electric power for its pumps. The pylons and high tension lines that carry electric current to the Djiri plant were damaged during the war. Engineers from the Societe Nationale d’Electricite (SNE) and ICRC diverted electricity through intact lines in the center of town. Although this will restore power to the plant, very little water can be pumped due to mechanical problems with the water pumps. In addition, water lines may not maintain pressure due to major breaks in the distribution line and open plumbing connections in many structures. The water mains sustained damage in three areas, and looters removed the majority of water fixtures, leaving many connections to the plumbing system open. Engineers estimate the Djiri water treatment plant may be operational in two to three weeks, that repairs to water mains may be completed in two to three months, and that the replacement of plumbing fixtures to houses and buildings may take several years. Looters took all the tools used to maintain and repair the plants, the laboratory equipment, and reagents for testing the water. Most workers who operate the water treatment plant have returned but are not motivated to work they have not been paid for 2 years. The quality of the water from the Djoue and Djiri is quite poor, especially right after a heavy rainfall. The source water is extensively treated to make it potable. The water treatment process consist of coagulation by aluminum sulfate, filtration through sand, and disinfection by chlorine. The plants have sufficient chemicals (alum, lime, chlorine) to last until the end of November, 1997. Bottled water is easy to find in markets, but the cost has increased up to six times the pre-war price. Water tankers that delivered water to Talangai are not operational. People collect water in 25 liter containers, which are abundant throughout the city. Projection Of Drinking Water Needs. Currently there is no acute water shortage in the city. SND and residents have adjusted to the postwar conditions. Water from the Djoue plant is being diverted to areas served by the Djiri plant. People in low elevation areas or by rivers have dug wells. Others are collecting and storing rain water or are walking to nearby water sources. People have reduced their water use. The city’s water consumption has been reduced because many residents fled during the war and have not returned. Shortages could occur if the population increases rapidly, if the Djoue water treatment plant breaks down, or if the Djiri water treatment plant cannot be operational soon. Another major problem facing people living in Brazzaville is contamination of the drinking water sources. Water supplied by the water treatment plants is insufficiently chlorinated. No chlorine was detected in ten water samples taken by the team from water taps throughout the city. Even if water is chlorinated at the plant, low pressure and breaks in the pipes allow contaminants to enter the distribution system. Wells dug near pit latrines may contain pathogens. People may not disinfect and properly store water. Two cases of cholera and seven cases of typhoid fever were reported at Makelekele Hospital in mid-November. Preliminary investigations implicate water as the route of transmission. The Response. WHO, SNDE, and SNE in coordination with other implementing agencies are managing activities to address water problems in Brazzaville. SNDE, with assistance from ICRC, operates the water treatment plants. SNDE and ICRC are providing enough chemicals for the water treatment plants to last through February 1998 and are working to secure consistent electric power to both plants. SNDE will procure materials to repair the water mains. Oxfam plans to repair the water mains for hospitals. ICRC and Oxfam plan to supply water to health centers during the emergency period. Oxfam intends to supply water to the northern part of the city until a normal supply of water is restored. The Ministry of Health (MOH), MSF, and IRC are conducting surveillance of waterborne diseases and reporting their findings to all organizations implementing activities in the water sector. ICRC uses two tankers (7 cubic meters and 15 cubic meters) to truck water to five water points (water bladder and distribution taps) in the northern parts of the city. A maximum of four trips per day yields a total capacity of 72 cubic meters for the bladder system. Two 6 cubic meter tankers are being constructed in Kinshasa for ICRC and may be operational by the end of November. ICRC wants to immediately establish 7 more water distribution areas with a total capacity of 70. More tankers are needed to keep the bladders full of water. Renting water tankers poses serious difficulties and is expensive. ICRC hopes to airlift two trucks with 15 cubic meter tanks from Nairobi to use in Brazzaville. Several NGOs provide water to health care facilities. Currently, MDM and MSF provide water to the Talangai and Makelekele Hospitals while ICRC supplies water to the University Hospital and other health facilities assisted by the ICRC medical program. ICRC and local medical health authorities plan to conduct a survey to determine the water supply situation at the 30 health centers in Brazzaville. Oxfam intends to establish six emergency water depots along the Tsieme River to provide an emergency supply of water for 4 months. Water from the Tsieme River, which runs between Talangie and Ouenze, is poor quality and must be chemically treated. The depots will provide 450 cubic meters of water per day a sufficient quantity of potable water for 90,000 people at 5 liters per person per day. Electric Power The three hydroelectric plants that provide electricity to Brazzaville were not damaged and remain operational. However, portions of the city do not receive electricity because aerial lines are down in the city center and Poto-Poto, and underground lines are damaged in the southern part of the city. In addition, the Djiri water treatment plant does not receive electricity because of damage to the pylons holding aerial high tension wires from the Moukouloulou power plant that lead into town. Current is being diverted around the damaged areas to provide electricity to the water treatment plant until repairs are completed by the local electric company and NGOs. Major repairs are expected to be completed by the end of November. The French companies, Lyoneise des Eaux and Electricitie de France, plan to rehabilitate the power plants. Sanitation Brazzaville has not had a municipal solid waste and sewage program. Consequently, waste and sewage were poorly managed before the war. Households collected and burned trash in their yards. Only 14% of the houses in Brazzaville had complete sanitary facilities: a flush toilet, water tap, and shower. Six out of ten houses had pit latrines while the remainder used septic tanks for sewage. The war interrupted the collection and removal of solid waste and produced a lot of debris from destroyed buildings. As people return and organize the large markets, more trash and garbage will be produced. Heavy rains carry trash and clog drainage canals, which causes the water to pool. Floods have occurred in Poto-Poto. People who returned to the city are moving trash, debris, and garbage from their lots to the outside of their property. Unfortunately, this material just accumulates, because it is not removed from the city. IV. Health Brazzaville was the regional headquarters for several UN agencies including UNICEF and WHO, who are responsible for health services. Prior to the war, the public health sector in Brazzaville was anchored by the University Hospital, Makelekele Hospital and 30 community health clinics. The clinic system was supported to a limited extent by the MOH. Cost-recovery through the collection of fees for medications was used to subsidize clinics and pay health staff. In addition to MOH affiliated clinics, organizations such as CRS/CARITAS managed clinical sites in under served neighborhoods. UNICEF representatives who worked in Brazzaville prior to the war report that pre-war childhood immunizations rates were approximately 75% nationwide. However, a review of pre-war immunization data suggests the immunization rate was approximately 50%. The amount of severe malnutrition (< -2 Z Scores) in Brazzaville in children 5 or less years of age steadily increased from 1986 through 1996. For example the rate of severe malnutrition increased from 2.9% in 1986 to 3.9% in 1991 to 4.6% in 1996. WFP had ongoing feeding programs throughout the country prior to the war. It is difficult to believe that the war of 1997 contributed to the improvement of the nutritional status of children. During the war, trauma services in Brazzaville contributed heavily to the acute health resource demands. The perspective of organizations working in the health sector throughout the war (primarily MSF and ICRC) is that acute malnutrition (e.g. acute protein and micronutrient deficiency) is not a major problem at this time, but that more definite population surveys are needed to identify vulnerable populations. During visits to clinics and hospitals and limited interaction with the population, the team did not see any evidence of acute malnutrition. No formal population-based nutritional assessment has been conducted since the war, and the team was unable to visit many regions where health services and food are thought to be in short supply. ICRC is currently conducting a nutritional assessment in the northern part of the country, and MSF and UNICEF plan to conduct one shortly in the rest of the country. A review of hospital admission data from University Hospital indicate that malaria, diarrheal diseases, and injuries from the war are the leading conditions for admission. A review of clinical data at the clinic treating IDPs indicates that malaria, respiratory disease, and diarrhea were the main reasons for treatment. No agency, hospital or clinic visited by the team in Brazzaville is conducting acute therapeutic feeding programs. On November 13, MSF reported 8 confirmed cases of typhoid and 2 suspected cases cholera in the Makelekele hospital. These are the first cases of both diseases identified since the war. All patients lived in Brazzaville; none left the city during the war. The cause of disease transmission is thought to be waterborne. No unified (multi-agency) disease surveillance and monitoring activity exists to guide clinical activities in Brazzaville. However, implementing partners held their first weekly health coordination meeting in Brazzaville in mid-November. Health-Related NGO and ICRC activities In Brazzaville, MSF supports the surgical ward at Makelekele hospital to address the needs of the war wounded. In the southern region of Brazzaville, four health centers and a mobile clinic serve IDP sites totaling 30,000 persons. CRS is operating several outpatient clinics and plans to establish a temporary system of 10-15 additional sites to serve the emergency outpatient needs of the population. UNICEF and Merlin are assessing health needs in the Brazzaville area. In Brazzaville, ICRC is rehabilitating and supporting emergency programs at University Hospital for a minimum of three months through a program of pharmaceuticals, food for patients, fuel for generators, and limited structure rehabilitation to attend the health needs of 200 inpatients. This program also includes war surgery technical support from an ICRC surgeon and plans for the restoration of water and power to essential hospital buildings. ICRC will provide limited repair, essential medications, and staff support to 20-30 former MOH affiliated clinics throughout Brazzaville and is seeking partners to rapidly assume this role. ICRC also plans to include these facilities in its water tanker delivery route. In the northern part of the country, MSF established a base of health operations in Gamboma and is providing support to Gamboma, Oyo, and Mossaka hospitals. These hospitals support a local clinic network. MSF supplies essential medications to these facilities and has established temporary health posts for displaced persons. MSF is also conducting a measles vaccination campaign for an estimated 50,000 children at Pool and Plateau, and is running a mobile clinic that provides health services along the main road north and south of Brazzaville. Limited Overview of Brazzaville's Hospitals The University Hospital, with a capacity of 1000 beds, is on the outskirts of the business district of Brazzaville. The hospital’s current operational capacity is 150 patients; 130 inpatients were registered at the time of the team’s visit. Only 7 patients were pediatric and 4 of 7 had been admitted due to complications of malaria. Five of the hospital’s seven surgical suites are operational. Water comes from a well but production is limited and electricity is generator dependent. The French Government and ICRC have committed to restore hospital services to accommodate a minimum of 200 patients. The Makelekele hospital, which has a capacity of 300 to 400 beds, is located in the southern part of Brazzaville. At the time of the teams visit, this hospital remained the most functional hospital in the city. MSF assists with the operation of the surgical suites for war wounded. The Talangai hospital, which has a capacity of 200 beds, is in the northernmost district of Brazzaville. The hospital is not a major inpatient facility at this time due to the lack of personnel and materials, water problems, and uncertainty as to who will be the facility’s long-term NGO partner. In the short term, this facility might not be a major contributor to inpatient needs of the city. This hospital had few patients at the time of the team’s visit. Observations  Other hospital facilities (such as military facilities) in the city were not assessed by the team and are thought to contribute less to the overall emergency public health and medical stabilization of the population of Brazzaville. Hospital services are improving as NGOs implement programs to expand their services.  Limited Overview of Brazzavilles’s Outpatient Department Activities MSF is managing temporary outpatient departments and a mobile clinic in the southern part of the city and plans to move to the northern part of the country as soon as local capacity increases. CRS/CARITAS is operating between 1-6 clinical sites in and around the city (up to 120 visits per day at one site). ICRC is providing basic support to rehabilitate and open as many as 30 clinics in Brazzaville which were part of the public health/clinical outpatient system serving much of the population of Brazzaville before the war. UNICEF and its implementing partners are very interested in supporting these clinics in the future. There is excellent NGO cooperation between the health sector organizations working in Brazzaville. Observations  Outpatient medical services for the population of Brazzaville need to be restored. Immediate assistance to restore vital clinical services, essential training of staff, provision of essential medications, and the assurance of proper water and sanitation are necessary to restore urgent public health and outpatient services to a minimal level. Several NGOs and ICRC plan to restore the emergency outpatient services capacity in Brazzaville. Emergency support for such activities will bring the best public health benefit for the population, particularly as more people return to Brazzaville. The team’s medical survey was limited to Brazzaville. Little is known about the public health and medical needs of the population within Angolan controlled areas southwest of the city, currently closed to the relief community. Significant numbers of IDPs are thought to reside there, and their needs are thought to be substantial.   V. Shelter Five months of war have impacted the neighborhoods of Brazzaville to varying degrees. Neighborhoods in the central part of the city were largely destroyed by heavy weapons fire while homes in the more residential northern and southern parts of the city were partially damaged by small arms fire and looting. The UN estimates that 5,000 houses were completely destroyed and that 45,000 houses were partially damaged. The typical house in Brazzaville is a 5x10 meter single story brick house with 4 rooms and corrugated tin roofing, surrounded by a garden plot. Most households have 6 to 8 people. A number of displaced people whose homes were destroyed or damaged currently reside in and around public buildings in Brazzaville. These people and displaced populations outside Brazzaville are not returning to their home in the city because their houses were destroyed, or because they lack the resources to repair or rebuild their homes. During the war, Caritas distributed blankets to the most vulnerable displaced families in the city but was unable to provide plastic sheeting before the onset of the rainy season. To respond to the immediate shelter needs, especially during the ongoing rainy season, of the residents of and returnees to Brazzaville, UNICEF and CRS plan to provide tents to families whose homes were completely destroyed, plastic sheeting to people whose homes were partially destroyed, and basic construction tools and materials to returnees whose homes were looted. Implementing agencies also plan to remove debris and tear down damaged structures. VI. Food According to MSF/H, only a few cases of malnutrition among residents of Brazzaville have been identified to date. However, food is in short supply, and UNHCR reports that prices have soared between 25% and 300%. As more people return to Brazzaville, the nutritional status of the resident population may deteriorate as food demands exceed the food supply in the city. For residents outside of Brazzaville, the burden of hosting IDPs reduces the already limited supply in rural areas. Many farmers have been forced to consume their seeds. Brazzaville markets, which are located in high population areas (north and south of the center of Brazzaville), contain local items (e.g., smoked fish, mangoes, carrots, onions, tomatoes, avocadoes, bananas), imported goods from Kinshasa (bread and beer) and items such as flour and rice presumably looted from warehouses and houses in the city. While food is available in the markets, there is limited ability to transport food and non-food items from rural areas into Brazzaville. Local WHO staff estimate that residents of Brazzaville relied on imported goods, especially wheat flour and rice, to meet 50% of their food needs before the war. To address food needs in the ROC, WFP, in collaboration with its implementing partners, plans to: provide a one month food ration (2,000 kilocalories per person per day) to 350,000 returnees; support 3,000 food-for-work beneficiaries; provide seed protection packages to 10,000 beneficiaries; provide supplementary feeding to 20,000 vulnerable people in Brazzaville; and distribute a general ration to 5,000 refugees in the ROC. In an attempt to stabilize the agriculture sector and address food needs in rural areas, FAO will distribute seeds (maize and vegetable), maize cuttings, and hand tools to farmers and rural host families. UNICEF and MSF plan to conduct a nutritional survey of the affected population throughout the country (a survey to assess food needs of vulnerable populations has not been conducted yet due to a lack of security). WFP’s food requirements are covered within the framework of their ongoing 1997 Great Lakes Regional Emergency Operation. Therefore, WFP is not requesting additional funds under the UN Flash Appeal to meet food requirements in the ROC. WFP has 3,000 MT of food in Pointe Noire ready for transport to Brazzaville and has procured additional food in Kinshasa to meet food needs in Brazzaville. WFP closed its Brazzaville office a year ago and will not reestablish a permanent office there. However, WFP will maintain a small office to carry out activities for up to six months. VII. Logistics The greatest impact of the war on the logistical support of Brazzaville was on transportation. Shortages that have occurred are due in part to the lack of resupply capabilities. NGOs have been doing their best to stretch critically short supplies as far as possible. The railroad between Pointe Noire and Brazzaville is the primary mode of transport for large shipments of goods via land. Pointe Noire is on the southwest coast of ROC and is a major seaport. Damage to a 400 meter rail section halted all railroad freight shipments. A proposal has been submitted to the new government by ATLAS, a French logistics NGO, to repair the damaged track with used spurs. At the airport, the terminal and control towers sustained major damage, the aircraft taxiway had minor damage from a mortar barrage, and the ramp and runway sustained no damage. The taxiway has been repaired and the airport is open for daytime cargo and local airline flights. The first flight from WFP arrived on November 12 with 76 tons of supplies, mostly food. Engineers and technicians will install a runway lighting system. Once completed, the airport will be accessible night and day. Commercial air traffic will be able to land when the towers are repaired. The ferry system, the primary link between Brazzaville and Kinshasa, operated sporadically at best throughout the war. The boats ceased operations during intense fighting, cutting Brazzaville off from logistical support. Currently, two small boats carry passengers and small parcels and make approximately 10-12 round trips. A single larger boat used for large parcels, vehicles, and passengers makes 2 complete trips every day. Because of security concerns, the last ferry leaves Brazzaville at 5 PM and the boats dock in Kinshasa. Roads within the city are open but are in very poor condition due to the lack of maintenance and the war. Roads outside of the city are not maintained at all. Most of these roads can only be used during the dry season. The roads in the Poto-Poto and the central business districts are also heavily cluttered with war debris. There was absolutely no sign anywhere of any type of heavy equipment to help facilitate the debris removal. There are few vehicles in Brazzaville. Vehicles that were not damaged from the war were stolen or stripped and are now inoperable. Four wheel drive vehicles are scarce, as most were stolen or are being used by the Cobra militia. NGOs living in Brazzaville must bring their vehicles from Kinshasa. Heavy trucks are non-existent in Brazzaville. ATLAS is shipping 9 heavy trucks from France. These trucks are scheduled to arrive in Brazzaville on or about the 1st of December. They will be used to haul relief supplies from the warehouses to the distribution centers in Brazzaville. Taxi service is beginning to start. ATLAS plans to establish a maintenance facility in one of the main warehouse buildings. Since no such service exists in Brazzaville, this facility will provide a service center for all of the NGO vehicles. Fuel supply is critical due to the war and the resulting halt of rail shipments. Supply should increase with the resumption of train service from Pointe Noire. Pointe Noire is a crude oil processing site and a distribution point for fuels. Most of Brazzaville’s warehouses were damaged during the fighting, broken into and looted. Consequently, any supplies left in Brazzaville were stolen. To protect humanitarian supplies, ATLAS has rented two large warehouse buildings on the Brazzaville pier. These will be used to secure incoming supplies and equipment and as the main re-distribution point. An auxiliary warehouse will be located at the airport to facilitate the offloading and security of airfreight shipments. The location of the warehouse sites is optimum since the railroad runs by directly by the airport and ends at the main warehouse location. This will definitely facilitate the safe and effective movement of supplies between both locations. VIII. Security On June 8, U.S. Ambassador Aubrey Hooks and the DCM evacuated Brazzaville. By June 19, all UN staff had evacuated. Only staff from MSF, ICRC, UNICEF, and CARITAS remained throughout the war. According to expatriates who stayed in Brazzaville during the war, security has steadily improved since the city fell to Sassou’s forces on October 14, 1997. When in Brazzaville, the team heard gunshots on many occasions but did not witness any gunfights. Much of the defensive positions throughout the city have been demobilized. Delegations from United Nations and various foreign embassies have returned to Brazzaville on day trips without incident. Currently, UN-hired Cobra militia serve as UN security within Brazzaville. ICRC and NGOs do not hire Cobra militia as armed escorts. The populations seems to be moving within their neighborhoods and markets, sidewalk restaurants and cafes are reopening. However, on the whole, the city seems to be empty. At present, limitations on movement of the populations throughout the city are caused primarily by the lack of transportation rather than by threats to personal security. The team noted that Angolan soldiers were standing guard in Brazzaville at the Makelekele Hospital and at the entrance to the airport during its visit. One truck load of Angolan soldiers entered the city from the south during on of the team’s visit to the city. Throughout the city, armed and unarmed ""Congolese soldiers"" thought to be a combination of soldiers from the new government and militia were milling around the city. Less than 5 security outposts were noted within the city during the team’s travels. Military road blocks and check points in town were removed during the first week of November. According to organizations working within Brazzaville, armed security incidents have continued in mid-November but were confined to ""soldier to soldier"" violence rather than attacks against expatriates. No vehicles were reported stolen from relief workers for the past 4 weeks. No NGO personnel reported violence being directed at their staff since the fall of Brazzaville. Relief agencies reported continued fighting in the south between Point Noire and Brazzaville between Angolan and UNITA forces. While the new government has reportedly disarmed 2,000 ex-Cobra militia, the demobilization of the total force has not been accomplished. Armed groups of men are scattered throughout the city without any apparent command and control. The UN security level was reduced from 5 to 4 on November 1. NGOs established permanent offices staffed with expatriates. Expatriate UN personnel continue to spend only 2-3 nights per week in Brazzaville. The State Department’s Office of Diplomatic Security prohibited the team from overnighting and U.S/ Embassy/Kinshasa required the team to travel with an armed ex-Cobra militia if unescorted by UN or NGO personnel. Several implementing agencies report that widespread incidents of rape and other acts of violence against women and children during the war. Such incidents have been reported throughout the country since the war. Due to the damage to the Brazzaville communications infrastructure, WFP is planning to install and maintain a complex communications system (with a VHF, satellite phone, fax, and E-mail) for UN agencies and NGOs operating in Brazzaville. IX. Refugees In the Democratic Republic of the Congo. UNHCR estimates that 39,600 Congolese crossed the river to the DROC between June and October to escape the war in Brazzaville. Of this total, an estimated 11,000 refugees live in the Kinkole refugee camp (36 km outside Kinshasa); the remainder reside with host families in Kinshasa and visit the Kinkole camp once a week to receive WFP-donated food rations. UNHCR estimates that an additional 20,000 Congolese refugees entered the DROC and now live with host families in the city and are not requesting assistance. To date, some 500 Congolese refugees have spontaneously repatriated to Brazzaville, and more cross back by river each day. In Kinkole refugee camp, WFP is providing a weekly food distribution (of cereals, pulses, oil, CSB, and salt) of 2,000 kilocalories per person per day and is providing supplementary feeding to malnourished children and pregnant women. UNHCR’s distribution of non-food items (jerry cans, kitchen sets, blankets) ended in early October. IFRC is providing health services at the dispensary, and is responsible for overall camp management, including warehousing and community services (e.g., funerals). Serious medical cases are referred to the hospital in Kinkole, 5 km from the camp. (UNHCR and IFRC provided tents, beds, medicines, and $3 per day to each refugee treated at the Kinkole hospital.) UNICEF, in coordination with IFRC, is conducting a measles and general vaccination campaign, and is distributing Vitamin A and deworming tablets to children ages 6 months to five years old. UNICEF is also providing pre-natal care and consultations, nutritional education, and psycho-social assistance to children traumatized by war. ATLAS constructed the Kinkole camp and main access road leading from Kinshasa to the camp, built camp latrines, set up rubhalls for warehousing, and built small makeshift huts for the refugees. MSF established a water system in the camp. On November 13 in Brazzaville, UNHCR officials met for the first time with Dr. Leon Alfred Opimba of the Ministry of Humanitarian Action, War and Disaster Victims to discuss the modalities of repatriating Congolese refugees in the DROC to Brazzaville. The GROC supports UNHCR’s planned repatriation operation, and welcomes the refugees home, but has expressed concern that an influx of people to Brazzaville at this time would strain the city’s limited resources and basic services. Starting on November 19, UNHCR will facilitate the informal repatriation of refuges from the DROC by paying the boat fare across the river for refugees anxious to return immediately to Brazzaville. For refugees willing to wait several weeks before returning to the ROC, UNHCR will launch a more formal repatriation operation from the DROC on December 1. At that time, UNHCR plans to distribute a returnee kit (food, plastic sheeting, kitchen sets, and towels) to refugees before they are repatriated to Brazzaville. In the Republic of the Congo. The ROC hosts between 11,000 and 12,000 Rwandan refugees in five camps: 5,000 in Loukolela (470 km north of Brazzaville); 2,600 in Ndjundu (50 km north of Liranga); 2,330 in Kintele (30 km north of Brazzaville); 744 in Impfondo (950 km north of Brazzaville); and 580 in Liranga (75 km north of Loukolela). When the fighting broke out in Brazzaville in June, refugees in Bilolo refugee camp, which was located by the military academy - a military target - in Brazzaville, relocated to Kintele. UNHCR estimates that 70% of the camp population in Loukolela, Ndjundu, and Liranga are male. As of mid-November, there were 102 Burundian refugees in Impfondo, 33 in Kintele, and a dozen in Loukolela. The percentage of unaccompanied children (UAC) in each camp is high. UNHCR reported 298 UAC in Loukolela, 100 UAC in Ndjundu, and 128 UAC in Kintele. MSF is responsible for overall camp management, and, in coordination with UNHCR, is distributing food and supporting health, water and sanitation services to all camps except Impfondo. According to UNHCR, refugees in Impfondo are adequately cared for by the host government and local population. ATLAS was responsible for site planning and providing logistical support in all camps. A UNHCR mission to the Kintele camp on October 29 and 30 found the majority of refugees in relatively good health with no high rates of morbidity. However, UNHCR reports that 4% of the population receive therapeutic feeding and 6.2% receive supplementary feeding. MSF/H, which provided services to this refugee population throughout the war, maintains in- and outpatient clinics, which are adequately supplied with basic drugs and medical equipment, and distributes a monthly food ration of beans, cornflour, and oil. The majority of refugees in Kintele live in thatched huts, and MSF provided plastic sheeting for additional shelter protection during the rainy season. UNHCR plans to start repatriating refugees in Kintele to Rwanda in late November (to date, UNHCR has registered 76 refugees in Kintele willing to return to Rwanda). However the majority of refugees in the ROC are unwilling to return to Rwanda and have requested continued UNHCR assistance. (Note: prior to the war, refugees in Ndjundu and Liranga were brought to Loukolela to be repatriated to Rwanda. UNHCR’s repatriation of Rwandan refugees from Loukolela to Rwanda stopped in June with the onset of the war.) For refugees unwilling to return to Rwanda, the GROC unofficially informed UNHCR that it plans to offer refugees land in the ROC. Depending on where the land is, UNHCR will consider transporting refugees from their current camps to their new location. UNHCR also plans to support this relocation by providing seeds and tools, a six month food package, and building materials to enable refugees to become self-sufficient. X. Coordination From October 21-24, an inter-agency (UNICEF, UN/DHA, WHO, UNDP, WFP, and CRS) Rapid Assessment Team assessed the needs of the remaining and returning populations in Brazzaville. Their assessment and findings from other assessments by the ICRC and NGOs provided the basis for the UN Consolidated Inter-Agency Flash Appeal for the Republic of Congo which was launched at a donor’s conference in Geneva on November 10. The Flash Appeal requests $17.7 million to address emergency humanitarian needs for displaced populations in the Brazzaville area from November 1997 to January 1998. (Note: while the objective of the Flash Appeal is to identify immediate humanitarian needs, the Flash Appeal requests funding for several rehabilitation activities - seeds and tools distribution, providing school materials, and supporting psycho-social activities for traumatized children. The Flash Appeal also requests funds for projects totaling $4.6 million already funded by ECHO.) In late November, the UN plans to assess the needs of vulnerable populations outside Brazzaville (in the north and south of the country) in anticipation of launching a subsequent appeal to cover an expanded area for a longer amount of time (at least 6 months) starting in February 1998. While NGOs will request funds directly from donors, many activities will be implemented jointly with UN agencies and NGOs and therefore some NGO activities are included in the Flash Appeal. Most requirements for ICRC activities in the ROC are already financed under ICRC’s Emergency Appeal for the DROC and ROC for the period February to December 1997. In early 1998, ICRC plans to launch an appeal to request funds to address humanitarian needs in the ROC. A UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, who is also the UNDP Resident Representative, was appointed on November 3 to coordinate humanitarian assistance to the ROC. Agencies responsible for the coordination of a specific sector have been selected. WFP is coordinating food aid to affected populations, and logistics and communications for all implementing agencies; WHO is coordinating and monitoring the health needs of the affected populations and will ensure standardized approaches to combating diseases; UNICEF is responding to needs of women and children; FAO is coordinating food production and some rehabilitation activities; and UNHCS/Habitat is responsible for emergency shelter activities. UN agencies and NGOs report good coordination of the emergency response to the conflict in the ROC. Since June, UNDHA has chaired weekly UN-NGO coordination meetings in Kinshasa to discuss the emergency in the ROC. Monthly meetings are also held in Kinshasa with heads of all UN agencies, NGOs and representatives from embassies, including the United States, to discuss the humanitarian situation in the Great Lakes Region, including the ROC. In mid-November, UN agencies and NGOs started convening weekly meetings in Brazzaville on individual sectors (e.g., health, water, shelter). UN agencies and NGOs report the host government is neither facilitating nor impeding humanitarian operations in the ROC. On November 10 in Brazzaville, the head of the Ministry of Humanitarian Action, War, and Disaster Victims, Dr. Leon Alfred Opimba, chaired the first coordination meeting of the new government with heads of all implementing agencies to discuss relief activities for the affected population in Brazzaville. Field representatives of ECHO, which is the major donor, proposed to ECHO headquarters a strategy similar to the team’s proposed USG strategy to fund short term (3 months) emergency projects that benefit the affected population in Brazzaville with a contingency to fund emergency activities benefiting other vulnerable groups outside the city. Since the war started, ECHO has provided at least $4.6 million to UN agencies (UNHCR and WFP), ICRC and NGOs (MSF, MDM, Oxfam) to address emergency health, water, and sanitation needs in Brazzaville. The team and ECHO met to discuss proposed strategies for response and ensure that if strategies were approved by their respective headquarters, there would be a coordinated response that would address all the emergency needs in the short term. The Government of France announced its commitment to bilaterally fund several rehabilitation and reconstruction programs, including providing radiological equipment to the Talangi hospital, equipment for both water treatment plants, and a team to rehabilitate the airport and repair the electric power lines.

Executive Summary On June 5, 1997, fighting erupted in Brazzaville when forces loyal to President Pascal Lissouba surrounded the residence of former president Denis Sassou Nguesso in an attempt to crack down on private militias prior to the presidential election scheduled for July 27. Despite regional and international mediation, both sides failed to reach agreement on the formation of a transitional government and the rescheduling of elections. Fighting intensified until October 14, when the conflict ended with a military victory by Sassou Nguesso. Five months of conflict have displaced large populations from the capital city of Brazzaville. More than 40,000 Congolese crossed the river and sought refuge in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DROC). Constant bombardment and shelling in Brazzaville destroyed the business district and left the economy in ruins. Structures that survived the war were completely stripped and looted. An estimated 20% of houses in the residential districts were damaged. The water system was damaged; access to potable water has been substantially reduced. Many of the city’s health centers were destroyed and looted. Food is in limited supply and prices have soared 25% to 300%. There is an ever-growing sanitation problem due to the clogging of the drainage system by the lack of maintenance and debris. Main port facilities and airport terminal buildings were destroyed. In response to a request for assistance from the Government of the Republic of the Congo (ROC), on October 27, U.S. Ambassador Aubrey Hooks declared a disaster situation, thus enabling USAID to respond. On November 4, USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Response’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (BHR/OFDA) deployed a four person team to assess and report on the conditions of the affected populations in Brazzaville and recommend options for the United States Government (USG). The assessment team was based in Kinshasa, DROC, and made day trips into Brazzaville, ROC. The team’s assessment was limited by lack of logistical support, security, and the U.S. Embassy/Kinshasa’s refusal to allow the team to stay overnight in Brazzaville. However, the team was able to conduct field assessments in Brazzaville, meet with representatives from UN agencies, ICRC and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) operating in the ROC, and participate in coordination meetings. The team departed Kinshasa on November 18, 1997. Based on its findings, the team concluded: 1. Displaced Populations. Of a total estimated pre-war population of 2.6 million in the ROC, between 800,000 and one million people lived in Brazzaville before the war. The current population of Brazzaville is estimated at 200,000, with between 100 and 1,000 people returning per week. Between 500,000 and 600,000 people are displaced north and south of the city. NGOs have been unable to assess the numbers and needs of displaced people in the corridor between Pointe Noire and Brazzaville. An estimated 5,000 people died in the conflict. 2. Water. There is no acute shortage of drinking water in the city even though the water treatment plant that provides water to the northern part of the city (about 40% of the pre-war population) is not operating. To accommodate for the loss of production, water from the other water treatment plant is being pumped to the northern parts of the city. People have adapted to the decreased supply by digging wells, collecting rain water, walking to nearby water sources, and conserving water. In addition, the city’s water consumption has been reduced because 80% of the residents fled the city during the war and have not returned. Although there is an adequate amount of water, contamination could occur. The operating water treatment plant does not effectively treat the water, people are digging shallow wells in areas close to pit latrines, chlorine is not available to disinfect collected water, and breaks in the water pipes and decreased water pressure can introduce contamination to the system. Shortages could occur if the population increases rapidly, if the only operating water treatment plant breaks down, or if the Djiri water treatment plant cannot be made operational soon. 3. Health. International relief organizations are working in and rehabilitating two hospitals in Brazzaville. Emergency public health and clinical services require emergency restoration, essential medications, and the assurance of potable water to serve the growing population of Brazzaville. Limited emergency outpatient services are available. Cases of typhoid and cholera were reported in mid-November among residents in Brazzaville. 4. Shelter. More than 5,000 homes are completely destroyed and 45,000 homes are damaged. There is a need for emergency repairs to houses in order to protect occupants during the rainy season, which will last until May. 5. Sanitation. Debris from the war, garbage, and trash that has accumulated has clogged drainage canals and caused pooling of water and flooding in low lying areas. 6. Food. While only a few cases of malnutrition were reported in Brazzaville, the nutritional status of the affected population may deteriorate as more people return to the city and sufficient food is not available. Host families in rural areas are strained by the added food needs for displaced populations and many farmers have been forced to consume their seeds. 7. Refugees. An estimated 39,600 Congolese sought refuge across the river in the DROC. Of this total, 11,000 refugees live in the UNHCR-assisted Kinkole refugee camp; the remainder reside with host families in Kinshasa and receive food assistance at Kinkole camp once a week. The ROC hosts between 11,000 and 12,000 Rwandan refugees. 8. Logistics. The logistics situation in Brazzaville is improving and the transportation of supplies into Brazzaville has started. The airport is open and 76 tons of relief supplies were airlifted into Brazzaville on November 12. Ferries between Kinshasa and Brazzaville are fully operational and are running a total of 10 round trips per day. There is still a critical shortage of vehicles. 9. Security. Security is improving in Brazzaville. Many relief agencies have established permanent offices staffed by expatriates. There have been no reports of security incidents involving humanitarian workers. Relief workers are able to move freely around the city. An estimated 2,000 Cobra militia were disarmed. On November 1, the UN reduced the security level from 5 to 4 in Brazzaville. Limited looting continues throughout the city. 10. Coordination. Coordination among relief agencies operating in Brazzaville is good. UN agencies are responsible for coordinating emergency needs in each sector. A UN Inter-Agency Consolidated Appeal for the ROC issued on November 10 requested $17.7 million to address emergency requirements from November 1997 to January 1998. The host government is neither facilitating nor hindering the delivery of assistance. ECHO is the major donor. II. Displaced Populations Of a pre-war population of 2.6 million in the ROC, between 800,000 and one million people lived in the capital city Brazzaville before the war. Due to fighting in and around Brazzaville for five months, between 500,000 and 600,000 people left the city. A breakdown of the displaced population includes: 200,000 people in Pointe Noire; 100,000 people between Brazzaville and Kinkala; 100,000 people north of Brazzaville as far as Impfondo; 60,000 people in the triangle formed by Nkayi, Sibiti, and Dolisie; and 50,000 people between Pointe Noire and Brazzaville. According to UNICEF, 65% of the displaced population are women and children. The current population of Brazzaville is estimated at 200,000 and there are an estimated 200,000 people who are unaccounted for. Since the war, between 100 to 1,000 people per week have been returning to Brazzaville. The UN reports that 10% of the residents of Poto-Poto have returned to date and between 40% to 50% have returned to the residential areas in northern Brazzaville. The host government has asked civil servants to return to the capital. Many returnees, upon finding their homes and places of employment destroyed, return immediately to the countryside. As a result there is a constant flow of people entering and exiting the city. Due to the present uncertainty regarding the political and economic situation and damage to the infrastructure in Brazzaville, the UN estimates that 70% of the displaced population (not including refugees) will return to Brazzaville before the end of the year. Other sources speculate that most internally displaced persons (IDPs) will not return to Brazzaville until basic services become operational. In Brazzaville, the displaced live with host families or in public buildings, where basic services are often unavailable. In rural areas, the displaced population exceeds the size of the residential population by as much as four times and strains their limited resources. Relief workers anticipate that displaced people may decide to resettle in their new locations and not return to Brazzaville. This is particularly true of those who fled to Pointe Noire, where the population is less dense and employment opportunities more available. Relief workers are concerned about the condition of the displaced population in the corridor between Pointe Noire and Brazzaville, where due to insecurity, NGOs have not been able to assess the numbers and conditions of the affected populations. III. Water Pre-war Conditions. The National Society for the Distribution of Drinking Water (SNDE) is responsible for the production and distribution of potable water in the ROC. In Brazzaville, they operate the Djoue and Djiri water treatment plants which are named after the rivers from which they obtain their water. The Djoue water treatment plant was built in 1956 and is in the Makelekele sector of the city. The plant has the capacity to pump water at 1500 cubic meters per hour. It is in poor mechanical condition and could break down at any time. The Djiri water treatment plant was built in 1986 and is 12 km north of the city center. It can potentially pump water at 2250 cubic meters per hour to the northern part of the city. Several problems plagued these water treatment plants prior to the war. The distribution system leaked 20% to 45% of the water, electric pumps often broke down, and electric power to the Djiri plant was sporadic. Residents served by these water treatment plants said that they usually do not have water pressure during the afternoon. A map of the water distribution system shows that 20% of the buildings in Brazzaville do not have access to a nearby public water tap. These include residences south of Makelekele, north of the Plateau section of the city, and in the districts of Talangai and Moungali. People living near a river or people who do not have access to city water may have a private well. The quality of water can be good if it comes from a well dug into a sandy river bank and is at least 50 feet from a pit latrine. (The water table in the southern part of Brazzaville is about 10 to 15 meters below the surface and the water table in the northern part ranges from 80 to 150 meters below the surface.) People living in the Plateau section do not have wells due to a low water table, but catch rain during the wet season (October to May). Water is trucked in during the dry season. People also buy water in half-liter plastic bags. Although the water treatment plants were not damaged by the war, the production of water has dropped 80%. The Djoue plant is partially operational and the Djiri plant does not have electric power for its pumps. The pylons and high tension lines that carry electric current to the Djiri plant were damaged during the war. Engineers from the Societe Nationale d’Electricite (SNE) and ICRC diverted electricity through intact lines in the center of town. Although this will restore power to the plant, very little water can be pumped due to mechanical problems with the water pumps. In addition, water lines may not maintain pressure due to major breaks in the distribution line and open plumbing connections in many structures. The water mains sustained damage in three areas, and looters removed the majority of water fixtures, leaving many connections to the plumbing system open. Engineers estimate the Djiri water treatment plant may be operational in two to three weeks, that repairs to water mains may be completed in two to three months, and that the replacement of plumbing fixtures to houses and buildings may take several years. Looters took all the tools used to maintain and repair the plants, the laboratory equipment, and reagents for testing the water. Most workers who operate the water treatment plant have returned but are not motivated to work they have not been paid for 2 years. The quality of the water from the Djoue and Djiri is quite poor, especially right after a heavy rainfall. The source water is extensively treated to make it potable. The water treatment process consist of coagulation by aluminum sulfate, filtration through sand, and disinfection by chlorine. The plants have sufficient chemicals (alum, lime, chlorine) to last until the end of November, 1997. Bottled water is easy to find in markets, but the cost has increased up to six times the pre-war price. Water tankers that delivered water to Talangai are not operational. People collect water in 25 liter containers, which are abundant throughout the city. Projection Of Drinking Water Needs. Currently there is no acute water shortage in the city. SND and residents have adjusted to the postwar conditions. Water from the Djoue plant is being diverted to areas served by the Djiri plant. People in low elevation areas or by rivers have dug wells. Others are collecting and storing rain water or are walking to nearby water sources. People have reduced their water use. The city’s water consumption has been reduced because many residents fled during the war and have not returned. Shortages could occur if the population increases rapidly, if the Djoue water treatment plant breaks down, or if the Djiri water treatment plant cannot be operational soon. Another major problem facing people living in Brazzaville is contamination of the drinking water sources. Water supplied by the water treatment plants is insufficiently chlorinated. No chlorine was detected in ten water samples taken by the team from water taps throughout the city. Even if water is chlorinated at the plant, low pressure and breaks in the pipes allow contaminants to enter the distribution system. Wells dug near pit latrines may contain pathogens. People may not disinfect and properly store water. Two cases of cholera and seven cases of typhoid fever were reported at Makelekele Hospital in mid-November. Preliminary investigations implicate water as the route of transmission. The Response. WHO, SNDE, and SNE in coordination with other implementing agencies are managing activities to address water problems in Brazzaville. SNDE, with assistance from ICRC, operates the water treatment plants. SNDE and ICRC are providing enough chemicals for the water treatment plants to last through February 1998 and are working to secure consistent electric power to both plants. SNDE will procure materials to repair the water mains. Oxfam plans to repair the water mains for hospitals. ICRC and Oxfam plan to supply water to health centers during the emergency period. Oxfam intends to supply water to the northern part of the city until a normal supply of water is restored. The Ministry of Health (MOH), MSF, and IRC are conducting surveillance of waterborne diseases and reporting their findings to all organizations implementing activities in the water sector. ICRC uses two tankers (7 cubic meters and 15 cubic meters) to truck water to five water points (water bladder and distribution taps) in the northern parts of the city. A maximum of four trips per day yields a total capacity of 72 cubic meters for the bladder system. Two 6 cubic meter tankers are being constructed in Kinshasa for ICRC and may be operational by the end of November. ICRC wants to immediately establish 7 more water distribution areas with a total capacity of 70. More tankers are needed to keep the bladders full of water. Renting water tankers poses serious difficulties and is expensive. ICRC hopes to airlift two trucks with 15 cubic meter tanks from Nairobi to use in Brazzaville. Several NGOs provide water to health care facilities. Currently, MDM and MSF provide water to the Talangai and Makelekele Hospitals while ICRC supplies water to the University Hospital and other health facilities assisted by the ICRC medical program. ICRC and local medical health authorities plan to conduct a survey to determine the water supply situation at the 30 health centers in Brazzaville. Oxfam intends to establish six emergency water depots along the Tsieme River to provide an emergency supply of water for 4 months. Water from the Tsieme River, which runs between Talangie and Ouenze, is poor quality and must be chemically treated. The depots will provide 450 cubic meters of water per day a sufficient quantity of potable water for 90,000 people at 5 liters per person per day. Electric Power The three hydroelectric plants that provide electricity to Brazzaville were not damaged and remain operational. However, portions of the city do not receive electricity because aerial lines are down in the city center and Poto-Poto, and underground lines are damaged in the southern part of the city. In addition, the Djiri water treatment plant does not receive electricity because of damage to the pylons holding aerial high tension wires from the Moukouloulou power plant that lead into town. Current is being diverted around the damaged areas to provide electricity to the water treatment plant until repairs are completed by the local electric company and NGOs. Major repairs are expected to be completed by the end of November. The French companies, Lyoneise des Eaux and Electricitie de France, plan to rehabilitate the power plants. Sanitation Brazzaville has not had a municipal solid waste and sewage program. Consequently, waste and sewage were poorly managed before the war. Households collected and burned trash in their yards. Only 14% of the houses in Brazzaville had complete sanitary facilities: a flush toilet, water tap, and shower. Six out of ten houses had pit latrines while the remainder used septic tanks for sewage. The war interrupted the collection and removal of solid waste and produced a lot of debris from destroyed buildings. As people return and organize the large markets, more trash and garbage will be produced. Heavy rains carry trash and clog drainage canals, which causes the water to pool. Floods have occurred in Poto-Poto. People who returned to the city are moving trash, debris, and garbage from their lots to the outside of their property. Unfortunately, this material just accumulates, because it is not removed from the city. IV. Health Brazzaville was the regional headquarters for several UN agencies including UNICEF and WHO, who are responsible for health services. Prior to the war, the public health sector in Brazzaville was anchored by the University Hospital, Makelekele Hospital and 30 community health clinics. The clinic system was supported to a limited extent by the MOH. Cost-recovery through the collection of fees for medications was used to subsidize clinics and pay health staff. In addition to MOH affiliated clinics, organizations such as CRS/CARITAS managed clinical sites in under served neighborhoods. UNICEF representatives who worked in Brazzaville prior to the war report that pre-war childhood immunizations rates were approximately 75% nationwide. However, a review of pre-war immunization data suggests the immunization rate was approximately 50%. The amount of severe malnutrition (< -2 Z Scores) in Brazzaville in children 5 or less years of age steadily increased from 1986 through 1996. For example the rate of severe malnutrition increased from 2.9% in 1986 to 3.9% in 1991 to 4.6% in 1996. WFP had ongoing feeding programs throughout the country prior to the war. It is difficult to believe that the war of 1997 contributed to the improvement of the nutritional status of children. During the war, trauma services in Brazzaville contributed heavily to the acute health resource demands. The perspective of organizations working in the health sector throughout the war (primarily MSF and ICRC) is that acute malnutrition (e.g. acute protein and micronutrient deficiency) is not a major problem at this time, but that more definite population surveys are needed to identify vulnerable populations. During visits to clinics and hospitals and limited interaction with the population, the team did not see any evidence of acute malnutrition. No formal population-based nutritional assessment has been conducted since the war, and the team was unable to visit many regions where health services and food are thought to be in short supply. ICRC is currently conducting a nutritional assessment in the northern part of the country, and MSF and UNICEF plan to conduct one shortly in the rest of the country. A review of hospital admission data from University Hospital indicate that malaria, diarrheal diseases, and injuries from the war are the leading conditions for admission. A review of clinical data at the clinic treating IDPs indicates that malaria, respiratory disease, and diarrhea were the main reasons for treatment. No agency, hospital or clinic visited by the team in Brazzaville is conducting acute therapeutic feeding programs. On November 13, MSF reported 8 confirmed cases of typhoid and 2 suspected cases cholera in the Makelekele hospital. These are the first cases of both diseases identified since the war. All patients lived in Brazzaville; none left the city during the war. The cause of disease transmission is thought to be waterborne. No unified (multi-agency) disease surveillance and monitoring activity exists to guide clinical activities in Brazzaville. However, implementing partners held their first weekly health coordination meeting in Brazzaville in mid-November. Health-Related NGO and ICRC activities In Brazzaville, MSF supports the surgical ward at Makelekele hospital to address the needs of the war wounded. In the southern region of Brazzaville, four health centers and a mobile clinic serve IDP sites totaling 30,000 persons. CRS is operating several outpatient clinics and plans to establish a temporary system of 10-15 additional sites to serve the emergency outpatient needs of the population. UNICEF and Merlin are assessing health needs in the Brazzaville area. In Brazzaville, ICRC is rehabilitating and supporting emergency programs at University Hospital for a minimum of three months through a program of pharmaceuticals, food for patients, fuel for generators, and limited structure rehabilitation to attend the health needs of 200 inpatients. This program also includes war surgery technical support from an ICRC surgeon and plans for the restoration of water and power to essential hospital buildings. ICRC will provide limited repair, essential medications, and staff support to 20-30 former MOH affiliated clinics throughout Brazzaville and is seeking partners to rapidly assume this role. ICRC also plans to include these facilities in its water tanker delivery route. In the northern part of the country, MSF established a base of health operations in Gamboma and is providing support to Gamboma, Oyo, and Mossaka hospitals. These hospitals support a local clinic network. MSF supplies essential medications to these facilities and has established temporary health posts for displaced persons. MSF is also conducting a measles vaccination campaign for an estimated 50,000 children at Pool and Plateau, and is running a mobile clinic that provides health services along the main road north and south of Brazzaville. Limited Overview of Brazzaville's Hospitals The University Hospital, with a capacity of 1000 beds, is on the outskirts of the business district of Brazzaville. The hospital’s current operational capacity is 150 patients; 130 inpatients were registered at the time of the team’s visit. Only 7 patients were pediatric and 4 of 7 had been admitted due to complications of malaria. Five of the hospital’s seven surgical suites are operational. Water comes from a well but production is limited and electricity is generator dependent. The French Government and ICRC have committed to restore hospital services to accommodate a minimum of 200 patients. The Makelekele hospital, which has a capacity of 300 to 400 beds, is located in the southern part of Brazzaville. At the time of the teams visit, this hospital remained the most functional hospital in the city. MSF assists with the operation of the surgical suites for war wounded. The Talangai hospital, which has a capacity of 200 beds, is in the northernmost district of Brazzaville. The hospital is not a major inpatient facility at this time due to the lack of personnel and materials, water problems, and uncertainty as to who will be the facility’s long-term NGO partner. In the short term, this facility might not be a major contributor to inpatient needs of the city. This hospital had few patients at the time of the team’s visit. Observations  Other hospital facilities (such as military facilities) in the city were not assessed by the team and are thought to contribute less to the overall emergency public health and medical stabilization of the population of Brazzaville. Hospital services are improving as NGOs implement programs to expand their services.  Limited Overview of Brazzavilles’s Outpatient Department Activities MSF is managing temporary outpatient departments and a mobile clinic in the southern part of the city and plans to move to the northern part of the country as soon as local capacity increases. CRS/CARITAS is operating between 1-6 clinical sites in and around the city (up to 120 visits per day at one site). ICRC is providing basic support to rehabilitate and open as many as 30 clinics in Brazzaville which were part of the public health/clinical outpatient system serving much of the population of Brazzaville before the war. UNICEF and its implementing partners are very interested in supporting these clinics in the future. There is excellent NGO cooperation between the health sector organizations working in Brazzaville. Observations  Outpatient medical services for the population of Brazzaville need to be restored. Immediate assistance to restore vital clinical services, essential training of staff, provision of essential medications, and the assurance of proper water and sanitation are necessary to restore urgent public health and outpatient services to a minimal level. Several NGOs and ICRC plan to restore the emergency outpatient services capacity in Brazzaville. Emergency support for such activities will bring the best public health benefit for the population, particularly as more people return to Brazzaville. The team’s medical survey was limited to Brazzaville. Little is known about the public health and medical needs of the population within Angolan controlled areas southwest of the city, currently closed to the relief community. Significant numbers of IDPs are thought to reside there, and their needs are thought to be substantial.   V. Shelter Five months of war have impacted the neighborhoods of Brazzaville to varying degrees. Neighborhoods in the central part of the city were largely destroyed by heavy weapons fire while homes in the more residential northern and southern parts of the city were partially damaged by small arms fire and looting. The UN estimates that 5,000 houses were completely destroyed and that 45,000 houses were partially damaged. The typical house in Brazzaville is a 5x10 meter single story brick house with 4 rooms and corrugated tin roofing, surrounded by a garden plot. Most households have 6 to 8 people. A number of displaced people whose homes were destroyed or damaged currently reside in and around public buildings in Brazzaville. These people and displaced populations outside Brazzaville are not returning to their home in the city because their houses were destroyed, or because they lack the resources to repair or rebuild their homes. During the war, Caritas distributed blankets to the most vulnerable displaced families in the city but was unable to provide plastic sheeting before the onset of the rainy season. To respond to the immediate shelter needs, especially during the ongoing rainy season, of the residents of and returnees to Brazzaville, UNICEF and CRS plan to provide tents to families whose homes were completely destroyed, plastic sheeting to people whose homes were partially destroyed, and basic construction tools and materials to returnees whose homes were looted. Implementing agencies also plan to remove debris and tear down damaged structures. VI. Food According to MSF/H, only a few cases of malnutrition among residents of Brazzaville have been identified to date. However, food is in short supply, and UNHCR reports that prices have soared between 25% and 300%. As more people return to Brazzaville, the nutritional status of the resident population may deteriorate as food demands exceed the food supply in the city. For residents outside of Brazzaville, the burden of hosting IDPs reduces the already limited supply in rural areas. Many farmers have been forced to consume their seeds. Brazzaville markets, which are located in high population areas (north and south of the center of Brazzaville), contain local items (e.g., smoked fish, mangoes, carrots, onions, tomatoes, avocadoes, bananas), imported goods from Kinshasa (bread and beer) and items such as flour and rice presumably looted from warehouses and houses in the city. While food is available in the markets, there is limited ability to transport food and non-food items from rural areas into Brazzaville. Local WHO staff estimate that residents of Brazzaville relied on imported goods, especially wheat flour and rice, to meet 50% of their food needs before the war. To address food needs in the ROC, WFP, in collaboration with its implementing partners, plans to: provide a one month food ration (2,000 kilocalories per person per day) to 350,000 returnees; support 3,000 food-for-work beneficiaries; provide seed protection packages to 10,000 beneficiaries; provide supplementary feeding to 20,000 vulnerable people in Brazzaville; and distribute a general ration to 5,000 refugees in the ROC. In an attempt to stabilize the agriculture sector and address food needs in rural areas, FAO will distribute seeds (maize and vegetable), maize cuttings, and hand tools to farmers and rural host families. UNICEF and MSF plan to conduct a nutritional survey of the affected population throughout the country (a survey to assess food needs of vulnerable populations has not been conducted yet due to a lack of security). WFP’s food requirements are covered within the framework of their ongoing 1997 Great Lakes Regional Emergency Operation. Therefore, WFP is not requesting additional funds under the UN Flash Appeal to meet food requirements in the ROC. WFP has 3,000 MT of food in Pointe Noire ready for transport to Brazzaville and has procured additional food in Kinshasa to meet food needs in Brazzaville. WFP closed its Brazzaville office a year ago and will not reestablish a permanent office there. However, WFP will maintain a small office to carry out activities for up to six months. VII. Logistics The greatest impact of the war on the logistical support of Brazzaville was on transportation. Shortages that have occurred are due in part to the lack of resupply capabilities. NGOs have been doing their best to stretch critically short supplies as far as possible. The railroad between Pointe Noire and Brazzaville is the primary mode of transport for large shipments of goods via land. Pointe Noire is on the southwest coast of ROC and is a major seaport. Damage to a 400 meter rail section halted all railroad freight shipments. A proposal has been submitted to the new government by ATLAS, a French logistics NGO, to repair the damaged track with used spurs. At the airport, the terminal and control towers sustained major damage, the aircraft taxiway had minor damage from a mortar barrage, and the ramp and runway sustained no damage. The taxiway has been repaired and the airport is open for daytime cargo and local airline flights. The first flight from WFP arrived on November 12 with 76 tons of supplies, mostly food. Engineers and technicians will install a runway lighting system. Once completed, the airport will be accessible night and day. Commercial air traffic will be able to land when the towers are repaired. The ferry system, the primary link between Brazzaville and Kinshasa, operated sporadically at best throughout the war. The boats ceased operations during intense fighting, cutting Brazzaville off from logistical support. Currently, two small boats carry passengers and small parcels and make approximately 10-12 round trips. A single larger boat used for large parcels, vehicles, and passengers makes 2 complete trips every day. Because of security concerns, the last ferry leaves Brazzaville at 5 PM and the boats dock in Kinshasa. Roads within the city are open but are in very poor condition due to the lack of maintenance and the war. Roads outside of the city are not maintained at all. Most of these roads can only be used during the dry season. The roads in the Poto-Poto and the central business districts are also heavily cluttered with war debris. There was absolutely no sign anywhere of any type of heavy equipment to help facilitate the debris removal. There are few vehicles in Brazzaville. Vehicles that were not damaged from the war were stolen or stripped and are now inoperable. Four wheel drive vehicles are scarce, as most were stolen or are being used by the Cobra militia. NGOs living in Brazzaville must bring their vehicles from Kinshasa. Heavy trucks are non-existent in Brazzaville. ATLAS is shipping 9 heavy trucks from France. These trucks are scheduled to arrive in Brazzaville on or about the 1st of December. They will be used to haul relief supplies from the warehouses to the distribution centers in Brazzaville. Taxi service is beginning to start. ATLAS plans to establish a maintenance facility in one of the main warehouse buildings. Since no such service exists in Brazzaville, this facility will provide a service center for all of the NGO vehicles. Fuel supply is critical due to the war and the resulting halt of rail shipments. Supply should increase with the resumption of train service from Pointe Noire. Pointe Noire is a crude oil processing site and a distribution point for fuels. Most of Brazzaville’s warehouses were damaged during the fighting, broken into and looted. Consequently, any supplies left in Brazzaville were stolen. To protect humanitarian supplies, ATLAS has rented two large warehouse buildings on the Brazzaville pier. These will be used to secure incoming supplies and equipment and as the main re-distribution point. An auxiliary warehouse will be located at the airport to facilitate the offloading and security of airfreight shipments. The location of the warehouse sites is optimum since the railroad runs by directly by the airport and ends at the main warehouse location. This will definitely facilitate the safe and effective movement of supplies between both locations. VIII. Security On June 8, U.S. Ambassador Aubrey Hooks and the DCM evacuated Brazzaville. By June 19, all UN staff had evacuated. Only staff from MSF, ICRC, UNICEF, and CARITAS remained throughout the war. According to expatriates who stayed in Brazzaville during the war, security has steadily improved since the city fell to Sassou’s forces on October 14, 1997. When in Brazzaville, the team heard gunshots on many occasions but did not witness any gunfights. Much of the defensive positions throughout the city have been demobilized. Delegations from United Nations and various foreign embassies have returned to Brazzaville on day trips without incident. Currently, UN-hired Cobra militia serve as UN security within Brazzaville. ICRC and NGOs do not hire Cobra militia as armed escorts. The populations seems to be moving within their neighborhoods and markets, sidewalk restaurants and cafes are reopening. However, on the whole, the city seems to be empty. At present, limitations on movement of the populations throughout the city are caused primarily by the lack of transportation rather than by threats to personal security. The team noted that Angolan soldiers were standing guard in Brazzaville at the Makelekele Hospital and at the entrance to the airport during its visit. One truck load of Angolan soldiers entered the city from the south during on of the team’s visit to the city. Throughout the city, armed and unarmed ""Congolese soldiers"" thought to be a combination of soldiers from the new government and militia were milling around the city. Less than 5 security outposts were noted within the city during the team’s travels. Military road blocks and check points in town were removed during the first week of November. According to organizations working within Brazzaville, armed security incidents have continued in mid-November but were confined to ""soldier to soldier"" violence rather than attacks against expatriates. No vehicles were reported stolen from relief workers for the past 4 weeks. No NGO personnel reported violence being directed at their staff since the fall of Brazzaville. Relief agencies reported continued fighting in the south between Point Noire and Brazzaville between Angolan and UNITA forces. While the new government has reportedly disarmed 2,000 ex-Cobra militia, the demobilization of the total force has not been accomplished. Armed groups of men are scattered throughout the city without any apparent command and control. The UN security level was reduced from 5 to 4 on November 1. NGOs established permanent offices staffed with expatriates. Expatriate UN personnel continue to spend only 2-3 nights per week in Brazzaville. The State Department’s Office of Diplomatic Security prohibited the team from overnighting and U.S/ Embassy/Kinshasa required the team to travel with an armed ex-Cobra militia if unescorted by UN or NGO personnel. Several implementing agencies report that widespread incidents of rape and other acts of violence against women and children during the war. Such incidents have been reported throughout the country since the war. Due to the damage to the Brazzaville communications infrastructure, WFP is planning to install and maintain a complex communications system (with a VHF, satellite phone, fax, and E-mail) for UN agencies and NGOs operating in Brazzaville. IX. Refugees In the Democratic Republic of the Congo. UNHCR estimates that 39,600 Congolese crossed the river to the DROC between June and October to escape the war in Brazzaville. Of this total, an estimated 11,000 refugees live in the Kinkole refugee camp (36 km outside Kinshasa); the remainder reside with host families in Kinshasa and visit the Kinkole camp once a week to receive WFP-donated food rations. UNHCR estimates that an additional 20,000 Congolese refugees entered the DROC and now live with host families in the city and are not requesting assistance. To date, some 500 Congolese refugees have spontaneously repatriated to Brazzaville, and more cross back by river each day. In Kinkole refugee camp, WFP is providing a weekly food distribution (of cereals, pulses, oil, CSB, and salt) of 2,000 kilocalories per person per day and is providing supplementary feeding to malnourished children and pregnant women. UNHCR’s distribution of non-food items (jerry cans, kitchen sets, blankets) ended in early October. IFRC is providing health services at the dispensary, and is responsible for overall camp management, including warehousing and community services (e.g., funerals). Serious medical cases are referred to the hospital in Kinkole, 5 km from the camp. (UNHCR and IFRC provided tents, beds, medicines, and $3 per day to each refugee treated at the Kinkole hospital.) UNICEF, in coordination with IFRC, is conducting a measles and general vaccination campaign, and is distributing Vitamin A and deworming tablets to children ages 6 months to five years old. UNICEF is also providing pre-natal care and consultations, nutritional education, and psycho-social assistance to children traumatized by war. ATLAS constructed the Kinkole camp and main access road leading from Kinshasa to the camp, built camp latrines, set up rubhalls for warehousing, and built small makeshift huts for the refugees. MSF established a water system in the camp. On November 13 in Brazzaville, UNHCR officials met for the first time with Dr. Leon Alfred Opimba of the Ministry of Humanitarian Action, War and Disaster Victims to discuss the modalities of repatriating Congolese refugees in the DROC to Brazzaville. The GROC supports UNHCR’s planned repatriation operation, and welcomes the refugees home, but has expressed concern that an influx of people to Brazzaville at this time would strain the city’s limited resources and basic services. Starting on November 19, UNHCR will facilitate the informal repatriation of refuges from the DROC by paying the boat fare across the river for refugees anxious to return immediately to Brazzaville. For refugees willing to wait several weeks before returning to the ROC, UNHCR will launch a more formal repatriation operation from the DROC on December 1. At that time, UNHCR plans to distribute a returnee kit (food, plastic sheeting, kitchen sets, and towels) to refugees before they are repatriated to Brazzaville. In the Republic of the Congo. The ROC hosts between 11,000 and 12,000 Rwandan refugees in five camps: 5,000 in Loukolela (470 km north of Brazzaville); 2,600 in Ndjundu (50 km north of Liranga); 2,330 in Kintele (30 km north of Brazzaville); 744 in Impfondo (950 km north of Brazzaville); and 580 in Liranga (75 km north of Loukolela). When the fighting broke out in Brazzaville in June, refugees in Bilolo refugee camp, which was located by the military academy - a military target - in Brazzaville, relocated to Kintele. UNHCR estimates that 70% of the camp population in Loukolela, Ndjundu, and Liranga are male. As of mid-November, there were 102 Burundian refugees in Impfondo, 33 in Kintele, and a dozen in Loukolela. The percentage of unaccompanied children (UAC) in each camp is high. UNHCR reported 298 UAC in Loukolela, 100 UAC in Ndjundu, and 128 UAC in Kintele. MSF is responsible for overall camp management, and, in coordination with UNHCR, is distributing food and supporting health, water and sanitation services to all camps except Impfondo. According to UNHCR, refugees in Impfondo are adequately cared for by the host government and local population. ATLAS was responsible for site planning and providing logistical support in all camps. A UNHCR mission to the Kintele camp on October 29 and 30 found the majority of refugees in relatively good health with no high rates of morbidity. However, UNHCR reports that 4% of the population receive therapeutic feeding and 6.2% receive supplementary feeding. MSF/H, which provided services to this refugee population throughout the war, maintains in- and outpatient clinics, which are adequately supplied with basic drugs and medical equipment, and distributes a monthly food ration of beans, cornflour, and oil. The majority of refugees in Kintele live in thatched huts, and MSF provided plastic sheeting for additional shelter protection during the rainy season. UNHCR plans to start repatriating refugees in Kintele to Rwanda in late November (to date, UNHCR has registered 76 refugees in Kintele willing to return to Rwanda). However the majority of refugees in the ROC are unwilling to return to Rwanda and have requested continued UNHCR assistance. (Note: prior to the war, refugees in Ndjundu and Liranga were brought to Loukolela to be repatriated to Rwanda. UNHCR’s repatriation of Rwandan refugees from Loukolela to Rwanda stopped in June with the onset of the war.) For refugees unwilling to return to Rwanda, the GROC unofficially informed UNHCR that it plans to offer refugees land in the ROC. Depending on where the land is, UNHCR will consider transporting refugees from their current camps to their new location. UNHCR also plans to support this relocation by providing seeds and tools, a six month food package, and building materials to enable refugees to become self-sufficient. X. Coordination From October 21-24, an inter-agency (UNICEF, UN/DHA, WHO, UNDP, WFP, and CRS) Rapid Assessment Team assessed the needs of the remaining and returning populations in Brazzaville. Their assessment and findings from other assessments by the ICRC and NGOs provided the basis for the UN Consolidated Inter-Agency Flash Appeal for the Republic of Congo which was launched at a donor’s conference in Geneva on November 10. The Flash Appeal requests $17.7 million to address emergency humanitarian needs for displaced populations in the Brazzaville area from November 1997 to January 1998. (Note: while the objective of the Flash Appeal is to identify immediate humanitarian needs, the Flash Appeal requests funding for several rehabilitation activities - seeds and tools distribution, providing school materials, and supporting psycho-social activities for traumatized children. The Flash Appeal also requests funds for projects totaling $4.6 million already funded by ECHO.) In late November, the UN plans to assess the needs of vulnerable populations outside Brazzaville (in the north and south of the country) in anticipation of launching a subsequent appeal to cover an expanded area for a longer amount of time (at least 6 months) starting in February 1998. While NGOs will request funds directly from donors, many activities will be implemented jointly with UN agencies and NGOs and therefore some NGO activities are included in the Flash Appeal. Most requirements for ICRC activities in the ROC are already financed under ICRC’s Emergency Appeal for the DROC and ROC for the period February to December 1997. In early 1998, ICRC plans to launch an appeal to request funds to address humanitarian needs in the ROC. A UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, who is also the UNDP Resident Representative, was appointed on November 3 to coordinate humanitarian assistance to the ROC. Agencies responsible for the coordination of a specific sector have been selected. WFP is coordinating food aid to affected populations, and logistics and communications for all implementing agencies; WHO is coordinating and monitoring the health needs of the affected populations and will ensure standardized approaches to combating diseases; UNICEF is responding to needs of women and children; FAO is coordinating food production and some rehabilitation activities; and UNHCS/Habitat is responsible for emergency shelter activities. UN agencies and NGOs report good coordination of the emergency response to the conflict in the ROC. Since June, UNDHA has chaired weekly UN-NGO coordination meetings in Kinshasa to discuss the emergency in the ROC. Monthly meetings are also held in Kinshasa with heads of all UN agencies, NGOs and representatives from embassies, including the United States, to discuss the humanitarian situation in the Great Lakes Region, including the ROC. In mid-November, UN agencies and NGOs started convening weekly meetings in Brazzaville on individual sectors (e.g., health, water, shelter). UN agencies and NGOs report the host government is neither facilitating nor impeding humanitarian operations in the ROC. On November 10 in Brazzaville, the head of the Ministry of Humanitarian Action, War, and Disaster Victims, Dr. Leon Alfred Opimba, chaired the first coordination meeting of the new government with heads of all implementing agencies to discuss relief activities for the affected population in Brazzaville. Field representatives of ECHO, which is the major donor, proposed to ECHO headquarters a strategy similar to the team’s proposed USG strategy to fund short term (3 months) emergency projects that benefit the affected population in Brazzaville with a contingency to fund emergency activities benefiting other vulnerable groups outside the city. Since the war started, ECHO has provided at least $4.6 million to UN agencies (UNHCR and WFP), ICRC and NGOs (MSF, MDM, Oxfam) to address emergency health, water, and sanitation needs in Brazzaville. The team and ECHO met to discuss proposed strategies for response and ensure that if strategies were approved by their respective headquarters, there would be a coordinated response that would address all the emergency needs in the short term. The Government of France announced its commitment to bilaterally fund several rehabilitation and reconstruction programs, including providing radiological equipment to the Talangi hospital, equipment for both water treatment plants, and a team to rehabilitate the airport and repair the electric power lines.

""This project will help small, private farms, as well as restructure the country's agro-industry,"" said Mark Lundell, Program Team Leader for the project. ""Armenia's rural sector has shown potential for improvement over the medium-term. This project will only increase that potential.""  The project will do the following:  Provide training and consultant services to assist in the   drafting of business plans presenting the medium-term    investment needs of privatized agro-industrial   enterprises. Most of these plans will be presented to the   participating financial institutions (PFIs) under the   Enterprise Development Project line of credit;    Develop a network of village credit associations that will   mobilize resources and provide loans and financial   services to small farmers and rural micro-enterprises;   and    Downsize agricultural research and extension while   increasing their focus on small farmers' needs for   information about sustainable agricultural practices and   availability of suitable agricultural technologies.  An estimated 35 percent of the credit proceeds will be passed on to PFIs for periods of 10-15 years at a floating LIBOR-based interest rate for on-lending to small-scale farmers and other rural entrepreneurs.  The credit will be repayable on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years including a 10-year grace period.

161,36689,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Rwanda Food Security Appeal,"THIS APPEAL SEEKS CHF 1,114,000 IN CASH, KIND AND SERVICES TO ASSIST 82,000 BENEFICIARIES FOR 9 MONTHS Appeal no: 12/98 Summary For the last several years the Prefecture of Gikongoro, situated in the South West of Rwanda has suffered chronic food shortages. The land is inherently difficult to farm, with high acidity levels in the soil and low use of fertiliser or other agricultural aids. The 400,000 people in the region are extremely poor and unable to upgrade their farming methods to cope with the challenges posed. The Government of Rwanda launched an appeal in October of 1997 for food support in Rwanda, identifying Gikongoro as one of the most needy regions. In February a Federation/Rwandan Red Cross Society assessment mission found visible evidence of serious malnutrition among children and adults. To counter this, the Federation seeks, through this appeal, to assist 82,000 people in the rural Communes of Mudasowa, Musebya, Muko and Musange with 504 mt of foodstuffs, 726 mt of cuttings and seeds, appropriate farm implements, fertilisers and soil dressing products. The Disaster At the end of 1996 Gikongoro Prefecture was struck by severe drought conditions which continued in 1997 until rains finally arrived in October. Unfortunately the rains came on too strongly and the resultant flooding washed away recent plantings of beans and sweet potatoes, forcing families to eat their seed crops to survive. Numerous factors conspired to reduce food production across the country and drive the prices of staple foods even higher. Production is still not back to 1990 levels, while insecurity in the Northwest, Rwanda's most fertile region, has greatly reduced the amount of land under cultivation. People are fleeing the area and hectares of farming land beside roads have been cleared to deny cover to paramilitaries. Food prices rose dramatically in 1997, doubling for beans and increasing ten fold for sweet potatoes. The lack of food has devastated the 13 communes of the prefecture and a recent FAO/WFP report estimates 70% of the households in Gikongoro are in urgent need of emergency aid. The malnutrition in the area is further aggravated by a mounting number of malaria cases that is being reported throughout the country. People weakened by hunger are proving more vulnerable to malaria and as food crops are diminished, people have less cash to buy medicine to fight the malaria. As a result the disease has made a virulent resurgence throughout the country. The Response so far Government Action The Government of Rwanda has announced a food deficit of 82,000 mt, confirmed by WFP in a press statement in mid-March. The Prefect of Gikongoro has appealed to the Rwandan Red Cross Society (RRCS) and the Federation to assist in his prefecture. Red Cross/Red Crescent Action RRCS/Federation have carried out two assessment missions to the region. In February the mission included an Agronomist, the Federation Senior Desk Officer and Senior Relief Officer. Other Agencies' Action In 1997 WFP, in co-operation with the government, distributed six monthly rations to over 500,000 people. In the first half of 1998 they hope to distribute to over 600,000 but may be unable to reach that target due to supply and logistics constraints. Though WFP carried out food distributions in Gikongoro in 1997, FAO advises that there is no action pending in the four communes targeted in this appeal.  Co-ordination The project will be co-ordinated by the Ministry of Agriculture, RRCS and the Federation Delegation in consultation with the WFP office in Kigali. The Intended Operation Assessment of Needs The findings of the RRCS/Federation assessment are supported by the FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Report issued on February 16. Insufficient food production, late rains followed by flooding and high malnutrition rates all point to the need for quick intervention. By way of illustration, in one area visited by the assessment team, 119 people were reported to have died from lack of food, and both children and adults were visibly malnourished. There is an urgent need follow food distributions with agricultural inputs to promote sustainability. Using government figures, some 82,000 people from 20,000 families are at risk, representing 62 % of the population of the communes targeted. Immediate Needs Beans, maize and palm oil are needed to meet the immediate food requirements of the population. The cost of the first distribution will be CHF 328,000. Anticipated Later Needs Given the need for quality seeds in the country the second phase of the programme will involve the purchase of wheat and bean seeds and cuttings for manioc and sweet potatoes, which will be used to provide more seeds, promoting sustainability and possibly even resulting in income generation in the long term. To address the problem of poor soil, lime and fertiliser will be supplied. Agricultural tools will also be distributed. With this assistance, the population in the communes will begin to get back on their feet in 1998 and will be able to continue improving the region's agricultural productivity through seed multiplication, using profits to finance further purchases of fertiliser. This second phase will be accompanied by a further distribution of foodstuffs to tide families over to the next harvest. This distribution of food as ""seed protection"" is in line with WFP recommendations for intervention in Rwanda for 1998. Red Cross Objectives  To provide food security to 82,000 people in Gikongoro Prefecture; to support, improve and help to stabilise agricultural production in the area; to train RRCS volunteers in the Prefecture in disaster response and agricultural assistance; to reduce ethnic tensions in the country by reducing competition for food resources. In conjunction with Rwandan Red Cross CBFA program, to reduce suseceptability to Malaria through public education on preventative and curative health measures.National Society/Federation Plan of Action Emergency Phase: April-July 1998 Red Cross action will include:  Distribution of emergency food rations to the most vulnerable population (orphans, elderly, disabled and ill); rehabilitation of existing agricultural infrastructure (water source protection, fertiliser inputs, anti erosion systems) utilising a Food for Work programme with the region's farmers.Phase Two: July - September 1998  Distribution of seeds, agricultural inputs and farm tools; continued rehabilitation of agricultural infrastructure; planning and planting of crops; continued distribution of emergency food to the most vulnerable; continuation of food for work schemes as a form of seed protection. monitoring the progress of crops.Phase Three: September - December 1998  Continued monitoring of the programme; analysis of the September harvest; planting for the next season.Capacity of the National Society RRCS was commended for its assistance to refugees returning from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania at the end of 1996. In the past few months it has assumed camp management responsibilities in Mudende and Byumbu, and it has sufficient numbers of volunteers at headquarters and prefecture level to assist with this programme. Its logistics department, with the support of the Federation Delegation, will handle logistical needs, and a consultant agricultural engineer working with FAO will provide technical support. Present Capacity of the Federation in Rwanda The Federation Delegation numbers 15 delegates, and agricultural expertise will be brought in on a short term basis as mentioned. The Head of Delegation and the Finance Delegate will assist in the areas of management reporting and financial administration. The Regional Logistics Centre in Nairobi will provide logistics support. Evaluation RRCS and the Federation Delegation will monitor the distributions. Evaluations will take place and reports will be issued at the end of each phase of the operation, i.e. in July, September and December. Conclusion As in many parts of Africa, weather conditions have caused severe damage to agricultural infrastructure and output in Rwanda. The immediate needs of the population must be covered, while simultaneously addressing the need for rehabilitation of the economy, especially in the agricultural sector. The prefecture of Gikongoro is one of the hardest hit in the country. With timely and appropriate interventions of seeds and other agricultural inputs, there is a prime opportunity to achieve a good harvest.

George Weber Secretary General Margareta Wahlström Under Secretary General, Disaster Response & Operations Coordination","Rwanda Food Security Appeal THIS APPEAL SEEKS CHF 1,114,000 IN CASH, KIND AND SERVICES TO ASSIST 82,000 BENEFICIARIES FOR 9 MONTHS Appeal no: 12/98 Summary For the last several years the Prefecture of Gikongoro, situated in the South West of Rwanda has suffered chronic food shortages. The land is inherently difficult to farm, with high acidity levels in the soil and low use of fertiliser or other agricultural aids. The 400,000 people in the region are extremely poor and unable to upgrade their farming methods to cope with the challenges posed. The Government of Rwanda launched an appeal in October of 1997 for food support in Rwanda, identifying Gikongoro as one of the most needy regions. In February a Federation/Rwandan Red Cross Society assessment mission found visible evidence of serious malnutrition among children and adults. To counter this, the Federation seeks, through this appeal, to assist 82,000 people in the rural Communes of Mudasowa, Musebya, Muko and Musange with 504 mt of foodstuffs, 726 mt of cuttings and seeds, appropriate farm implements, fertilisers and soil dressing products. The Disaster At the end of 1996 Gikongoro Prefecture was struck by severe drought conditions which continued in 1997 until rains finally arrived in October. Unfortunately the rains came on too strongly and the resultant flooding washed away recent plantings of beans and sweet potatoes, forcing families to eat their seed crops to survive. Numerous factors conspired to reduce food production across the country and drive the prices of staple foods even higher. Production is still not back to 1990 levels, while insecurity in the Northwest, Rwanda's most fertile region, has greatly reduced the amount of land under cultivation. People are fleeing the area and hectares of farming land beside roads have been cleared to deny cover to paramilitaries. Food prices rose dramatically in 1997, doubling for beans and increasing ten fold for sweet potatoes. The lack of food has devastated the 13 communes of the prefecture and a recent FAO/WFP report estimates 70% of the households in Gikongoro are in urgent need of emergency aid. The malnutrition in the area is further aggravated by a mounting number of malaria cases that is being reported throughout the country. People weakened by hunger are proving more vulnerable to malaria and as food crops are diminished, people have less cash to buy medicine to fight the malaria. As a result the disease has made a virulent resurgence throughout the country. The Response so far Government Action The Government of Rwanda has announced a food deficit of 82,000 mt, confirmed by WFP in a press statement in mid-March. The Prefect of Gikongoro has appealed to the Rwandan Red Cross Society (RRCS) and the Federation to assist in his prefecture. Red Cross/Red Crescent Action RRCS/Federation have carried out two assessment missions to the region. In February the mission included an Agronomist, the Federation Senior Desk Officer and Senior Relief Officer. Other Agencies' Action In 1997 WFP, in co-operation with the government, distributed six monthly rations to over 500,000 people. In the first half of 1998 they hope to distribute to over 600,000 but may be unable to reach that target due to supply and logistics constraints. Though WFP carried out food distributions in Gikongoro in 1997, FAO advises that there is no action pending in the four communes targeted in this appeal.  Co-ordination The project will be co-ordinated by the Ministry of Agriculture, RRCS and the Federation Delegation in consultation with the WFP office in Kigali. The Intended Operation Assessment of Needs The findings of the RRCS/Federation assessment are supported by the FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Report issued on February 16. Insufficient food production, late rains followed by flooding and high malnutrition rates all point to the need for quick intervention. By way of illustration, in one area visited by the assessment team, 119 people were reported to have died from lack of food, and both children and adults were visibly malnourished. There is an urgent need follow food distributions with agricultural inputs to promote sustainability. Using government figures, some 82,000 people from 20,000 families are at risk, representing 62 % of the population of the communes targeted. Immediate Needs Beans, maize and palm oil are needed to meet the immediate food requirements of the population. The cost of the first distribution will be CHF 328,000. Anticipated Later Needs Given the need for quality seeds in the country the second phase of the programme will involve the purchase of wheat and bean seeds and cuttings for manioc and sweet potatoes, which will be used to provide more seeds, promoting sustainability and possibly even resulting in income generation in the long term. To address the problem of poor soil, lime and fertiliser will be supplied. Agricultural tools will also be distributed.

162,36987,[4589],Contributions,Iraq Emergency Relief Update,"CHURCH WORLD SERVICE EMERGENCY RESPONSE OFFICE 34 Denominations & Communions Working Together to Meet Human Needs UPDATE HUMANITARIAN APPEAL: IRAQ EMERGENCY RELIEF Disaster Bulletin No. #976801 for $150,000 (Issued Feb. 5, 1998) SUMMARY: A Church World Service delegation delivered nearly $100,000 worth of medicines to twochildren's hospitals in Iraq during an April 8-13 Easter Week visit. The medicines were part of CWS's efforts to assist the Ecumenical Relief Service of the Middle East Council of Churches (MECC) provide humanitarian assistance to Iraq. The CWS contribution was part of a $2.2 million appeal by Action by Churches Together (ACT) International. SPECIFICS: The delegation's trip was often painful, as participants witnessed some of the enormous difficulties facing Iraq. ""I have seen people living under all sorts of difficult conditions all over the world, but I have never before seen death stare at me in the eyes of a little baby,"" said the Rev. Dr. Rodney Page, CWS Executive Director, after visiting a children's hospital in Baghdad. Page -- joined by Rick Augsburger, CWS/ERO Director, David Weaver, CWS Middle East Office Director, other CWS representatives and leaders of the MECC and the American Friends Service Committee and Lutheran World Relief -- witnessed the impact of eight years of United Nations-imposed sanctions, which have deprived the Iraqi people of essential food, medicine and other goods. The sanctions were imposed by the UN Security Council after Iraq invaded and occupied Kuwait in August 1990. More than 1.2 million Iraqis, half of them under the age of five, have died since 1990 as a direct result of the sanctions, and 6,000 more die every month. After the delegation arrived at Ibn Biladi Hospital, members witnessed the death of a malnourished infant girl who died of a chest infection that could have been cured with ordinary antibiotics - had they been available in time. Minutes later, the group witnessed the death of another infant. Mothers later pressed prescriptions into Dr. Page's hand, pleading for medicine - and milk - for their children. Page and others of the delegation said CWS and its member denominations and communions need to press for an end to the economic, non-military sanctions against Iraq, ""which are hurting the most vulnerable of the Iraqi citizens,"" Dr. Page said. ""It's not the politicians who are suffering, but the children, the women, the poor, the sick, the elderly."" APPEAL SPECIFICS: The Easter delivery of medicines is part of CWS's overall approximately $3 million in humanitarian aid to Iraq and other countries affected by the Gulf Crisis since 1991. In addition to medical shipments, CWS has assisted the in-kind portion of the ACT appeal by sending $250,000 in blankets and $75,000 in layettes to Ecumenical Relief Services, which has sought to provide 50,000 blankets to communities in need and layettes to 10,000 newborn children. With donations of medicine, blankets and layettes, CWS will have contributed $50,000 in operational support and $425,000 in material aid to the ACT appeal. The following denominations have contributed to the CWS portion of the ACT appeal and their support has been critical and is greatly appreciated: Brethren Service Center: $10,000 Christian Church (Disciples): $6,000 Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.): $40,000 United Church of Christ: $20,000 In addition, Lutheran World Relief has sent 5,000 layettes and 20,000 quilts in material assistance. (These figures are based on information available as of April 21. Information provided to CWS/ERO may not yet be complete and the following figures are not final. Some financial contributions may not yet have been noted. If there are changes or corrections, please contact CWS/ERO and changes/corrections will be included in future appeal updates.) NEEDS: So far, denominational support has come to $76,000. Another $74,000 is needed for a second medical shipment scheduled for later this year.

163,37027,[4600],Protection and Human Rights,Statement on Amnesty International's Report,"UNITED NATIONS NATIONS UNIES International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda Press and Public Affairs Unit Arusha International Conference Centre P.O. Box 6016, Arusha, Tanzania Tel: 255 57 4207-11/4367-72 or 1 212 963 2850 Fax: 255 57 4000/4373 or 1 212 963 2848 E-Mail: Public@UN.org ICTR/INFO-9-2-117 Arusha, 29 April 1998 It is fashionable in some quarters to denigrate and distort the efforts of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, to wilfully suppress the achievements it has recorded in the most challenging conditions and under new senior management through the hard work of dedicated staff, and to draw invidious comparisons with national domestic machineries of justice and the Yugoslavia Tribunal in The Hague, which is operating in a different environment that dictates its own approach to various aspects of its mandate. To the extent that Amnesty International has joined this bandwagon, the Tribunal finds it a matter of regret. To the extent that Amnesty International wishes to assist the ICTR in its task of dispensing justice for the victims of the genocide, and in that spirit is prepared to offer constructive remarks and suggestions, then the Tribunal welcomes its contribution. The ICTR's comments and clarifications on some significant issues contained in Amnesty International's report are as follows. JEAN KAMBANDA (FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF RWANDA) Amnesty International criticises Mr. Kambanda's detention in a safe house, but ignores the fact that a safe house can genuinely be for the accused's own protection and comfort. Tihomir Blaskic, indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, was for a long time detained at the ICTY in a safe house which was greatly more commodious than the cells of the Detention Unit. Paragraph 41 of the ICTY's Fourth Annual Report states: ""41. The conditions of Blaskic's detention were again modified this year in a Decision of the President of the Tribunal rendered on 9 January 1997, which increased the exercise and fresh air periods enjoyed by the detainee, as well as permitting him more familial visits than he had been previously allowed"". ICTR does not recall Amnesty criticising this arrangement. Amnesty International seems to suggest that it is never permissible for a detainee to be detained in any place other than the United Nations Detention Unit. This is certainly not the position under the Statute or Rules of Procedure of the ICTR, by which the Tribunal is governed. Rule 64 provides:- Upon his transfer to the seat of the Tribunal, the accused shall be detained in facilities provided by the host country or by another country. The President may, on the application of a party, request modification of the conditions of detention of an accused. (Emphasis added). The wording of this Rule shows that Amnesty's comments and suggestions have no basis and is ill-founded. What is important is that all the Rules and Regulations of the Tribunal and international standards concerning detention are fully respected. The ICTR has ensured this. In that connection the Tribunal has facilitated visitation to Mr. Kambanda by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) the body with the most recognised mandate to monitor respect for international human rights standards in conditions of detention. Amnesty International states in its report that it is ""concerned that a dangerous precedent has been set for national authorities to agree that they can overlook these international standards in some cases"". First, as shown above, no precedent has been set by this Tribunal for overlooking international standards. On the contrary, we have ensured the application of those standards. Second, the precedent of using a ""safe house""was in fact set in The Hague with the detention of Tihomir Blaskic in a ""safe house"". FRODUALD KARAMIRA (FORMER VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE MDR POLITICAL PARTY) Amnesty International alleges that the ICTR did not ""strenuously pursue"" its ""request"" to the Government of Ethiopia for Karamira's transfer to Arusha as a ""concession"" to the Rwandan Government. This is another example of armchair allegations that have no basis in fact. The ICTR did not file a request for the surrender of Mr. Karamira with the Ethiopian authorities, let alone fail to ""strenuously pursue"" it as alleged by Amnesty. The Tribunal recalls that it has concurrent jurisdiction with national Governments, including the Government of Rwanda, to prosecute individuals responsible for the Rwanda genocide. While the Tribunal has primacy of jurisdiction, it does not have exclusive jurisdiction. As a practical matter, given the Tribunal's limited life span, it will not be able to prosecute the thousands of individuals implicated in the genocide. This necessarily means that the bulk of these individuals will be prosecuted in Rwanda. ALLEGED UNLAWFUL DETENTION OF ESDRAS TWAGIRIMANA Mr. Esdras Twagirimana was mistakenly arrested during the Tribunal's Operation NAKI on 17 July 1997, during which several high-ranking individuals in the former Rwandan Government suspected or charged with genocide were arrested in Nairobi, Kenya. Amnesty's account of this case misses the fundamental point that, contrary to Amnesty's allegations, Esdras Twagirimana was not detained by this Tribunal. The facts:- a) After the discovery that Mr. Twagirimana was arrested by virtue of having been mistaken for another suspect, he was briefed accordingly. In particular, he was informed that he was going to be transferred to Nairobi where he was living. b) Mr. Twagirimana then informed the Tribunal authorities that he was residing illegally in Kenya and that he would probably be arrested and transferred to Kigali if he were to be returned immediately to Nairobi. Naturally fearing this prospect, he requested the ICTR's assistance to assist with the regularization of his immigration status so that he could reside either in Kenya or in Tanzania, and he signed a waiver to that effect. c) High-level contacts were then initiated by the Registrar with the Kenyan and Tanzanian authorities and with the UNHCR in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. d) The Tanzanian authorities offered refugee status to Mr. Twagirimana and his family if the latter accepted to live in a refugee camp. This offer was rejected by Mr. Twagirimana. The UNHCR initially accepted to grant legal status to Mr. Twagirimana if no criminal charges were outstanding against him by the Government of Kenya. e) Negotiations were still underway when Mr. Twagirimana began insistently to request that he be released. There was no choice but to return him to Nairobi where he was arrested, since he had no ties with Tanzania nor any regular status vis-a-vis the Tanzanian immigration authorities. On the basis of previous discussions, it was agreed that Mr. Twagirimana would be transferred to the Kenyan authorities (where he was in fact arrested and handed over to the Tribunal) with the understanding that UNHCR would take the necessary steps to grant him refugee status. f)  It should therefore be clear that: (i) the stay of Mr. Twagirimana in Arusha was made at his request and was consensual; (ii) the Tribunal did its very best to cope with a humanitarian situation, the final resolution of which was neither in the Tribunal's hands nor its province; (iii) from the day Mr. Twagirimana expressed the wish to go back to Kenya, arrangements were made accordingly, with the added precaution of requesting UNHCR closely to follow his treatment by the Kenyan authorities. By requesting the Tribunal's assistance to work for the regularization of his immigration status Mr. Twagirimana was no longer detained under the authority of the Tribunal. The category of persons who are detained under the authority of the Tribunal - and thus fall within the Tribunal's rules and regulations - is not expandable at will. It comprises accused, suspects and witnesses, and no others. A few further clarifications: The Kenyan authorities made it very clear to the Tribunal that they were not willing to grant any special treatment to Mr. Twagirimana. Mr. Twagirimana was briefed accordingly. That is why contacts were made with UNHCR in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi to provide him either with refugee status prior to his arrival at Nairobi, or to make the necessary arrangements for his case to be followed-up with special emphasis after his arrival in Nairobi. On the basis of previous contacts with UNHCR, the transfer of Mr. Esdras Twagirimana was scheduled for 20 September 1997. At the last minute UNHCR informed the Tribunal of its inability to secure, as agreed earlier, ""special treatment"" for Mr. Esdras Twagirimana. As regards compensation, it may be helpful to look at an ICTY precedent. At the ICTY, one Goran Lajic was arrested, having been mistaken for the accused Goran Lajic, indicted by the ICTY in the Keraterm camp case (IT-95-8-T). When the error was discovered, he was released (see Order for the Withdrawal of the Charges Against the Person Named Goran Lajic and for His Release, 17 June 1996). His counsel, Toma Fila, requested compensation. This request was referred to the Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs and Legal Counsel of the UN who quite unequivocally replied that compensation by the United Nations was in these circumstances quite out of the question. PRE-TRIAL CUSTODY The Tribunal is committed to avoiding lengthy pre-trial custody of accused persons, and welcomes constructive suggestions in that regard. The Tribunal cannot be held responsible for the length of pre-trial detention of accused persons detained under the domestic law of any country prior to their physical surrender to the Tribunal. Once suspects or accused are under the custody of the Tribunal, however, the Tribunal has consistently acted within the provisions of its Statute and Rules of Procedure. In this context, it is necessary, given the magnitude of the crimes under the Tribunal's jurisdiction - genocide, crimes against humanity, and violations of Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions - to weigh the need to apprehend the accused persons at the earliest opportunity and commence the legal/judicial processes (which often has several initial steps before the commencement of the trial proper) against the possibility of the accused individual eluding justice completely. Prosecution of Alleged Abuses by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) Genocide and other violations of international humanitarian law occurred in Rwanda in 1994. The Tribunal's mandate is to prosecute persons responsible for these gross violations, and that is exactly what it has been doing and will continue to do. The ICTR prosecutes accused individuals on the basis of concrete evidence, not on the basis of political considerations. WITNESS SUPPORT The ICTR's Witness and Victims Support Section (WVSS) has successfully brought to and returned from Arusha more than 100 protected witnesses who have testified in trials in the Tribunal. Of these witnesses, a total of 10 witnesses considered to be particularly at risk have been permanently relocated. No potential or actual witness before the Tribunal has lost his or her life on account of such witnesses' actual or potential testimony or the Tribunal. The reality of the effectiveness of the Tribunal's work in this crucial area is therefore vastly different from that depicted by Amnesty International's report. The track record of this section is all the more significant given the cultural dynamics and specific environment of the Great Lakes region where a culture of witness protection is not deeply rooted, as well as the current security situation in parts of Rwanda, all of which pose a daunting challenge to the Tribunal and the international community. In view of the above, the expertise and experience required for effective work in witness support is a combination of legal academic qualification and relevant field experience and knowledge of the operating environment coupled with a police or military/ security background, socio-psychological training, and a great sense of discretion, tact, and dedication. All staff of the WVSS have these qualifications. Additional staff with relevant qualifications have been recruited to work in this area in recent months, and further recruitment is ongoing. A sub-unit of the section has been established and staffed in Kigali. Furthermore, the section has benefited from the assistance of experts and consultants seconded to the Tribunal by UN Member States such as the United States and the United Kingdom. Thus, Amnesty's statement in its report, that "" In October 1997 the Victims and Witnesses Unit did not have any person who had expertise and experience of witness protection at a national level and Amnesty International understands that this had not changed""can only be described as wilfully misinformed at the least. PUBLIC INFORMATION ICTR agrees that ""the Tribunal will only attract political and financial support of [S]tates if it is able to publicize its activities effectively"". To this end the Registry has overhauled and reinvigorated the Tribunal's public information and communication strategy. This new strategy is proactive. It is directed simultaneously at the media, Governments, specialized professional groups, academia, and the general public, with the strategic aim of cultivating, enhancing and sustaining their support for the Tribunal's work. In this connection, the Registrar and other designated officials of the Tribunal have in the past year given interviews and published articles in a wide range of international media, and representatives of several of these media have visited the Tribunal and observed its work firsthand. These media are too numerous for comprehensive listing here, but include CNN, BBC, Asahi Shimbun, The New York Times, Le Monde, The London Guardian, Radio France Internationale, and the African media. The quality, quantity and diversity of the products of the Press and Public Affairs Unit have been significantly improved. In addition to its general press releases and the periodical ICTR Bulletin, the unit now publishes an ICTR Update which provides more detailed information about the Tribunal's legal/judicial processes and is aimed at lawyers, academics, institutes, Governments and nongovernmental organizations who are interested in a more in-depth analysis of the work of the Tribunal. At the same time, the Tribunal has been actively and systematically disseminating its work on the electronic information superhighway through an arrangement with Africa News Service, a respected non-profit news service in the United States whose web site is the most popular Africa-related resource on the Internet (receiving more than a million hits each month). This organization also publishes the Tribunal's press releases, updates and other material on Africa News Online, a daily news service distributed to major online services such as Lexis/Nexis, Comtex, CompuServe, Data Times, and Financial Times Information. Furthermore, the ICTR's own website is scheduled to become operational in May 1998, and will feature the Tribunal's basic documents, decisions, judgements, directives, manual for practitioners, and other material. ICTR has commenced a systematic liaison with law schools and other relevant academic institutions around the world, whereby the work of the Tribunal has been given center stage in their international law, human rights and criminal justice curriculum. The mailing list maintained by the Press and Public Affairs Unit has been radically expanded and is continuously updated. The feedback the Tribunal has received from its target audiences clearly indicates that the image of the ICTR has changed fundamentally in a positive direction. At the same time, the Tribunal continues to receive a steady stream of visiting delegations from Member States, including recently a U.S. Congressional delegation, the Minister of Justice of Belgium and the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom. It is curious indeed that all these improvements are due to a public information set-up that is, as the Amnesty International's report condescendingly put it, ""confused and uninformed."" It is obvious from the foregoing that the Tribunal has a public communication strategy that has proven successful and progressively effective over the past several months. Furthermore, Amnesty International wades into administrative matters in the ICTR that are beyond its human rights role when it addresses the question of the vacant position of a ""Chief of Information"". Nevertheless, as part of implemented and continuing internal administrative reforms, the senior management of the Tribunal initiated action - well before the Amnesty report - to fill this position.

Box 6016, Arusha, Tanzania Tel: 255 57 4207-11/4367-72 or 1 212 963 2850 Fax: 255 57 4000/4373 or 1 212 963 2848 E-Mail: Public@UN.org ICTR/INFO-9-2-117 Arusha, 29 April 1998 It is fashionable in some quarters to denigrate and distort the efforts of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, to wilfully suppress the achievements it has recorded in the most challenging conditions and under new senior management through the hard work of dedicated staff, and to draw invidious comparisons with national domestic machineries of justice and the Yugoslavia Tribunal in The Hague, which is operating in a different environment that dictates its own approach to various aspects of its mandate. To the extent that Amnesty International has joined this bandwagon, the Tribunal finds it a matter of regret. To the extent that Amnesty International wishes to assist the ICTR in its task of dispensing justice for the victims of the genocide, and in that spirit is prepared to offer constructive remarks and suggestions, then the Tribunal welcomes its contribution. The ICTR's comments and clarifications on some significant issues contained in Amnesty International's report are as follows. JEAN KAMBANDA (FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF RWANDA) Amnesty International criticises Mr. Kambanda's detention in a safe house, but ignores the fact that a safe house can genuinely be for the accused's own protection and comfort. Tihomir Blaskic, indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, was for a long time detained at the ICTY in a safe house which was greatly more commodious than the cells of the Detention Unit. Paragraph 41 of the ICTY's Fourth Annual Report states: ""41. The conditions of Blaskic's detention were again modified this year in a Decision of the President of the Tribunal rendered on 9 January 1997, which increased the exercise and fresh air periods enjoyed by the detainee, as well as permitting him more familial visits than he had been previously allowed"". ICTR does not recall Amnesty criticising this arrangement. Amnesty International seems to suggest that it is never permissible for a detainee to be detained in any place other than the United Nations Detention Unit. This is certainly not the position under the Statute or Rules of Procedure of the ICTR, by which the Tribunal is governed. Rule 64 provides:- Upon his transfer to the seat of the Tribunal, the accused shall be detained in facilities provided by the host country or by another country. The President may, on the application of a party, request modification of the conditions of detention of an accused. (Emphasis added). The wording of this Rule shows that Amnesty's comments and suggestions have no basis and is ill-founded. What is important is that all the Rules and Regulations of the Tribunal and international standards concerning detention are fully respected. The ICTR has ensured this. In that connection the Tribunal has facilitated visitation to Mr. Kambanda by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) the body with the most recognised mandate to monitor respect for international human rights standards in conditions of detention. Amnesty International states in its report that it is ""concerned that a dangerous precedent has been set for national authorities to agree that they can overlook these international standards in some cases"". First, as shown above, no precedent has been set by this Tribunal for overlooking international standards. On the contrary, we have ensured the application of those standards. Second, the precedent of using a ""safe house""was in fact set in The Hague with the detention of Tihomir Blaskic in a ""safe house"". FRODUALD KARAMIRA (FORMER VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE MDR POLITICAL PARTY) Amnesty International alleges that the ICTR did not ""strenuously pursue"" its ""request"" to the Government of Ethiopia for Karamira's transfer to Arusha as a ""concession"" to the Rwandan Government. This is another example of armchair allegations that have no basis in fact. The ICTR did not file a request for the surrender of Mr. Karamira with the Ethiopian authorities, let alone fail to ""strenuously pursue"" it as alleged by Amnesty. The Tribunal recalls that it has concurrent jurisdiction with national Governments, including the Government of Rwanda, to prosecute individuals responsible for the Rwanda genocide. While the Tribunal has primacy of jurisdiction, it does not have exclusive jurisdiction. As a practical matter, given the Tribunal's limited life span, it will not be able to prosecute the thousands of individuals implicated in the genocide. This necessarily means that the bulk of these individuals will be prosecuted in Rwanda. ALLEGED UNLAWFUL DETENTION OF ESDRAS TWAGIRIMANA Mr. Esdras Twagirimana was mistakenly arrested during the Tribunal's Operation NAKI on 17 July 1997, during which several high-ranking individuals in the former Rwandan Government suspected or charged with genocide were arrested in Nairobi, Kenya. Amnesty's account of this case misses the fundamental point that, contrary to Amnesty's allegations, Esdras Twagirimana was not detained by this Tribunal. The facts:- a) After the discovery that Mr. Twagirimana was arrested by virtue of having been mistaken for another suspect, he was briefed accordingly. In particular, he was informed that he was going to be transferred to Nairobi where he was living. b) Mr. Twagirimana then informed the Tribunal authorities that he was residing illegally in Kenya and that he would probably be arrested and transferred to Kigali if he were to be returned immediately to Nairobi. Naturally fearing this prospect, he requested the ICTR's assistance to assist with the regularization of his immigration status so that he could reside either in Kenya or in Tanzania, and he signed a waiver to that effect. c) High-level contacts were then initiated by the Registrar with the Kenyan and Tanzanian authorities and with the UNHCR in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. d) The Tanzanian authorities offered refugee status to Mr. Twagirimana and his family if the latter accepted to live in a refugee camp. This offer was rejected by Mr. Twagirimana. The UNHCR initially accepted to grant legal status to Mr. Twagirimana if no criminal charges were outstanding against him by the Government of Kenya. e) Negotiations were still underway when Mr. Twagirimana began insistently to request that he be released. There was no choice but to return him to Nairobi where he was arrested, since he had no ties with Tanzania nor any regular status vis-a-vis the Tanzanian immigration authorities. On the basis of previous discussions, it was agreed that Mr. Twagirimana would be transferred to the Kenyan authorities (where he was in fact arrested and handed over to the Tribunal) with the understanding that UNHCR would take the necessary steps to grant him refugee status. f)  It should therefore be clear that: (i) the stay of Mr. Twagirimana in Arusha was made at his request and was consensual; (ii) the Tribunal did its very best to cope with a humanitarian situation, the final resolution of which was neither in the Tribunal's hands nor its province; (iii) from the day Mr. Twagirimana expressed the wish to go back to Kenya, arrangements were made accordingly, with the added precaution of requesting UNHCR closely to follow his treatment by the Kenyan authorities. By requesting the Tribunal's assistance to work for the regularization of his immigration status Mr. Twagirimana was no longer detained under the authority of the Tribunal. The category of persons who are detained under the authority of the Tribunal - and thus fall within the Tribunal's rules and regulations - is not expandable at will. It comprises accused, suspects and witnesses, and no others. A few further clarifications: The Kenyan authorities made it very clear to the Tribunal that they were not willing to grant any special treatment to Mr. Twagirimana. Mr. Twagirimana was briefed accordingly. That is why contacts were made with UNHCR in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi to provide him either with refugee status prior to his arrival at Nairobi, or to make the necessary arrangements for his case to be followed-up with special emphasis after his arrival in Nairobi. On the basis of previous contacts with UNHCR, the transfer of Mr. Esdras Twagirimana was scheduled for 20 September 1997. At the last minute UNHCR informed the Tribunal of its inability to secure, as agreed earlier, ""special treatment"" for Mr. Esdras Twagirimana. As regards compensation, it may be helpful to look at an ICTY precedent. At the ICTY, one Goran Lajic was arrested, having been mistaken for the accused Goran Lajic, indicted by the ICTY in the Keraterm camp case (IT-95-8-T). When the error was discovered, he was released (see Order for the Withdrawal of the Charges Against the Person Named Goran Lajic and for His Release, 17 June 1996). His counsel, Toma Fila, requested compensation. This request was referred to the Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs and Legal Counsel of the UN who quite unequivocally replied that compensation by the United Nations was in these circumstances quite out of the question. PRE-TRIAL CUSTODY The Tribunal is committed to avoiding lengthy pre-trial custody of accused persons, and welcomes constructive suggestions in that regard.

164,37040,[4589],Contributions,UCAH Donor News Vol. 6 April 1998,"REG. NO. 98/0040 United Nations Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Unit-UCAH First donations to the 1998 UN Consolidated Appeal: came from Greece, South Africa and the Finnish Refugee Council. It is the first time Greece and the Finnish Refugee Council have made cash contributions toward an Appeal in Angola. South Africa's contribution is particularly significant as it represents solidarity among African nations and their commitment to assist neighboring countries during critical periods of need. Three months after launching the 1998 United Nations Inter-Agency Consolidated Appeal, the response is beginning to gain momentum. Eight donors have made contributions/pledges including Greece, South Africa, Finnish Refugee Council, France, Norway, United Kingdom, NC Australia and the United States. Together contributions amount to 11.4% of the total Appeal requirements. Critical funding needs: IOM, UNHCR, and WFP have urgent funding needs that must be met in the coming weeks in order to continue their activities. (see critical requirements chart)  IOM listed four projects in the 1998 Appeal which are integrated components that support MINARS in the implementation of the National Programme for IDPs and newly resettled communities. In order to maintain its operational capacity until the end of June 1998, IOM has broken down its overall requirements to reflect its funding needs for the first half of 1998 which amount to US$3,400,000. UNHCR is experiencing a funding crisis due to the lack of new contributions for 1998. To respond to this crisis, UNHCR Headquarters has loaned UNHCR in Angola US$3 million from its General Allocation for Voluntary Repatriation Fund (GAVR). However, these funds will not cover operating costs for the first quarter which has prompted UNHCR to prioritize its program activities and existing budget. Currently, UNHCR is requesting US$ 16 million (which has been revised from their original requirement of US$ 23 million) for activities that will almost exclusively focus on the return of Angolan refugees, therefore dramatically reducing the level of reintegration activities possible unless additional funding is secured. WFP has been forced to charge NGOs for the transport of non-food items since limited funds have been received for this activity. Under this policy, NGOs must access funds not intended for this activity or are otherwise unable to transport their goods to the field. Funding for passenger air service also remains critical as only one contribution has been received for this activity. In order to keep services going in the short-term, WFP urgently requests US$ 1,000,000 for transport of non-food items and US$ 2,500,000 for passenger air service if humanitarian activities are to continue without causing financial hardship to the humanitarian community Humanitarian situation: The overall humanitarian situation could be characterized as stable, yet most humanitarian organizations are facing a period of doubt and insecurity.  The Provinces of Uige, Malange, Lunda Norte and Sul, Bie, Huambo, Benguela and Huila continue to experience high levels of insecurity. During the first quarter of this year, these provinces suffered from incidences of banditry, organized military attacks, kidnapping of local populations, and other destabilizing activities as well as remining of roads and paths. While NGO and UN agency staff have not in general been targeted in these attacks the atmosphere for field workers is in many areas tense and unstable. In addition, aid workers are increasingly harassed and threatened by elements of ANP and FAA. This harassment is believed to be caused by the high level of fear or frustration felt by ANP and FAA members placed in areas recently normalized by State Administration. Within this context, many IDPs are preparing to return to their areas of origin, however, many other small pockets of new IDPs have been created by the recent wave of banditry and attacks, and it is reasonable to expect that close monitoring of this situation and maintenance of a rapid response mechanism should be kept throughout 1998. While these indicators show a tense and fragile situation on the ground (at municipal and communal levels), State administrators working in provincial capitals appear to be showing more interest in issues of development and coordination.

NO. 98/0040 United Nations Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Unit-UCAH First donations to the 1998 UN Consolidated Appeal: came from Greece, South Africa and the Finnish Refugee Council. It is the first time Greece and the Finnish Refugee Council have made cash contributions toward an Appeal in Angola. South Africa's contribution is particularly significant as it represents solidarity among African nations and their commitment to assist neighboring countries during critical periods of need. Three months after launching the 1998 United Nations Inter-Agency Consolidated Appeal, the response is beginning to gain momentum. Eight donors have made contributions/pledges including Greece, South Africa, Finnish Refugee Council, France, Norway, United Kingdom, NC Australia and the United States. Together contributions amount to 11.4% of the total Appeal requirements. Critical funding needs: IOM, UNHCR, and WFP have urgent funding needs that must be met in the coming weeks in order to continue their activities. (see critical requirements chart)  IOM listed four projects in the 1998 Appeal which are integrated components that support MINARS in the implementation of the National Programme for IDPs and newly resettled communities. In order to maintain its operational capacity until the end of June 1998, IOM has broken down its overall requirements to reflect its funding needs for the first half of 1998 which amount to US$3,400,000. UNHCR is experiencing a funding crisis due to the lack of new contributions for 1998. To respond to this crisis, UNHCR Headquarters has loaned UNHCR in Angola US$3 million from its General Allocation for Voluntary Repatriation Fund (GAVR). However, these funds will not cover operating costs for the first quarter which has prompted UNHCR to prioritize its program activities and existing budget. Currently, UNHCR is requesting US$ 16 million (which has been revised from their original requirement of US$ 23 million) for activities that will almost exclusively focus on the return of Angolan refugees, therefore dramatically reducing the level of reintegration activities possible unless additional funding is secured. WFP has been forced to charge NGOs for the transport of non-food items since limited funds have been received for this activity. Under this policy, NGOs must access funds not intended for this activity or are otherwise unable to transport their goods to the field. Funding for passenger air service also remains critical as only one contribution has been received for this activity. In order to keep services going in the short-term, WFP urgently requests US$ 1,000,000 for transport of non-food items and US$ 2,500,000 for passenger air service if humanitarian activities are to continue without causing financial hardship to the humanitarian community Humanitarian situation: The overall humanitarian situation could be characterized as stable, yet most humanitarian organizations are facing a period of doubt and insecurity.  The Provinces of Uige, Malange, Lunda Norte and Sul, Bie, Huambo, Benguela and Huila continue to experience high levels of insecurity. During the first quarter of this year, these provinces suffered from incidences of banditry, organized military attacks, kidnapping of local populations, and other destabilizing activities as well as remining of roads and paths. While NGO and UN agency staff have not in general been targeted in these attacks the atmosphere for field workers is in many areas tense and unstable. In addition, aid workers are increasingly harassed and threatened by elements of ANP and FAA. This harassment is believed to be caused by the high level of fear or frustration felt by ANP and FAA members placed in areas recently normalized by State Administration. Within this context, many IDPs are preparing to return to their areas of origin, however, many other small pockets of new IDPs have been created by the recent wave of banditry and attacks, and it is reasonable to expect that close monitoring of this situation and maintenance of a rapid response mechanism should be kept throughout 1998. While these indicators show a tense and fragile situation on the ground (at municipal and communal levels), State administrators working in provincial capitals appear to be showing more interest in issues of development and coordination. Humanitarian coordination structures and other State initiatives seem to be advancing as the Government realizes the need for basic services, particularly in areas where State Administration was recently normalized.

165,37048,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Appeal for Sudanese Refugees Resettlement,"Adjumani, UgandaSudanese Refugees Resettlement - AFUG 81 Appeal Target : US$ 361,000 Geneva, April 27, 1998 Dear Friends, The protracted civil war in Sudan has, since 1983, resulted in major influxes of refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries and, since mid-1986, there have been significant population displacements across the border into Uganda. Initially, transit camps were set up to deal with the regular onslaught of displaced persons and, since 1989, local settlements of refugees have been developed allowing the refugees to become more independent and self sufficient. As of end 1997, Adjumani, Uganda has a caseload of 68,599 displaced persons, with some 51,000 of these in the process of becoming established in local settlements. Food relief is no longer provided to four settlements where the refugees have become self sufficient, whilst in some camps the relief has been greatly reduced. But, all the remaining transit camps and the majority of settlements continue to be partly or fully dependent on food relief. Furthermore new refugee settlements are being developed in an area to the south of Adjumani, where communication and social infrastructure is very poor or non-existent. Lutheran World Federation/World Service (LWF/WS) working as UNHCR’s main partner, aims to provide refugee assistance in 4 transit camps and 25 local settlements. LWF/WS strives to meet the basic refugee needs of food, water, shelter and protection, aid the transition of those still in transit camps to local settlements and ensure that all refugee households have access to cultivatable land to help in their becoming self reliant and develop basic infrastructual and social facilities such as health, schooling, roads/bridges etc. ACT assistance is being requested to meet the basic life sustaining needs of those who have not yet attained food self sufficiency and self reliance in the Adjumani district and who, because of the continuing conflict in the Sudan cannot return to their pre-emergency lives. We thank you in advance for your support. Please kindly send your contributions to the ACT bank account.

II. IMPLEMENTING ACT MEMBER And PARTNER INFORMATION LWF/WS Uganda, as above III. DESCRIPTION Of The EMERGENCY SITUATION Type of emergency - Human madeThe protracted Sudanese Peoples Liberation Army - Government of Sudan civil war has resulted in major population displacements since 1983 and refugees fleeing across the border into northern Uganda from mid 1986 onwards. Major influxes were received into Moyo and Gulu districts in 1989, 1991 and again in 1994. The first of 3 adjacent transit camps was opened by UNHCR in Ogujebe on the east bank of the Albert Nile in 1986, on land provided by the Government of Uganda. In mid 1994 a fourth smaller transit camp was opened primarily for Dinka refugees some 30 km away near Adjumani town. Local settlement of refugees was begun in mid 1989 when the first of 25 relatively small settlements was developed in Adjumani district. A further local settlement began to be developed across the Nile in Moyo district in 1995. As of 31 December 1997 the total Sudanese refugee population in Adjumani district was 68,599, with a further 22,000 in the process of being resettled in Moyo district. Current Situation - Post Crisis PhaseOf the present refugee caseload of 68,599 in Adjumani district, some 51,000 are now in the process of becoming established in local settlements and the transit camp’s populations had been reduced to less that 17,600 by 31 December 1997, with a further 114 unaccompanied minors in institutional care. Food relief is no longer being provided in four settlements (pop. 1,974) where refugees have reached food self-sufficiency, cereal rations have been reduced to 50% in 8 settlements (pop. 8,090) whilst cereal rations have been cut by 20% in a further 3 settlements (pop. 5,958). Refugees in the more recent 10 settlements (pop 34,887) being developed together with the 17,690 refugees in transit camps and unaccompanied minor centers still require full food rations for survival. Date of emergency - 1 January - 31 December 1998It is extremely unlikely that the conditions of civil war and instability in south Sudan will improve in the short term. Furthermore, given the ethnic composition of the vast majority of Sudanese refugees in Adjumani districts, it is most unlikely that they will voluntarily repatriate to their home areas in the short term, even if the SPLA gain firm control of them. Location of emergency - Adjumani district (formerly East Moyo county, Moyo district) close to the Sudanese border in north-west Uganda. Refugees are located in 4 transit camps, and 25 local settlements scattered throughout the district. The district covers an area of some 3,300 sq. km with an estimated national population of some 85,500; the majority of whom were themselves refugees in South Sudan from 1980 - 86. The area suffered major infrastructual damage and decay in the post-Amin period, which has not yet been fully rehabilitated. The majority of the population is rural and primarily dependent on subsistence agriculture. Soil is moderately fertile with rainfall slightly above 1,000 mm in a bimodal pattern, two crops per annum can be produced. Adjumani town (pop. circa 2,500) is approx. 450km by road from Kampala but only accessible under military escort from Gulu. There are regular charter flights between Adjumani and Entebbe. Impact On Human LivesAll refugees in transit camps and the majority in local settlements are dependent on relief agencies for food, water, health and education services. Almost 11,000 of the 25,500 transferred to local settlements pre 1996 have insufficient cultivatable land to become food self-sufficient (many are little better off than they were in transit where no cultivatable land is available). The remaining 40,000 in local settlements should achieve food self-sufficiency within the next two years, while further settlements are being developed for the approx. 14,000 refugees remaining in the main transit camps together with 11,000 in unviable old settlements. This will still leave approximately 3,700, primarily Dinka refugees in transit as both the national population and local government authorities are unwilling to provide settlement land for them. Description of DamagesNew refugee settlements are primarily being developed in the now relatively sparsely inhabited south of the district, where communication and social infrastructure was either poorly developed or destroyed in the immediate post Amin period. As there is little that can be rehabilitated, resettlement calls for new basic infrastructure such as roads, bridges, schools, water supplies, health facilities, etc. to be constructed and maintained by the programme. New homes, latrines, etc. have to be constructed by the refugees themselves being transferred to settlements. Locations For ACT Appeal Response - Adjumani districtLWF/WS is involved in providing refugee assistance in all 4 transit camps and 25 local settlements in the district. As UNHCR’s main partner, LWF is responsible for multi-sectoral assistance including food distribution, transport and logistics (including central mechanical workshop operation) non-food item management, transit camp water operation and maintenance, settlement planning and development (including land demarcation, refugee transfer and settlement, roads/bridges and health facility construction), aspects of social services provision, refugee registration and general camp management. No less than five other international NGOs - ACORD, ACF, AHA, AEF and JRS are, under agreements with UNHCR, involved in the provision of agriculture/forestry, water development, health/sanitation and education assistance to refugees in the district. Food is being provided by World Food Programme to extended delivery points managed by LWF. Disaster and Emergency StatisticsLWF is responsible for refugee registration and recording population movements, and updated population and demographic data is provided on a monthly basis to UNHCR, government and partners organizations. There is no disagreement on figures. The last registration exercise was undertaken by UNHCR in collaboration with Government and LWF in October 1997. Current Security SituationThe district including local national and refugee settlements is subject to intermittent insecurity primarily caused by Lords Resistance Army rebels infiltrating from adjoining Gulu district. UNRF II and West Nile Bank Front rebels also occasionally cause insecurity incidents. All project supplies en route to Adjumani have to travel through war torn Gulu district under infrequent military escorts. LWF/WS staff coordinate closely with the Ugandan police and army and are in constant radio contact with them and all other partner organizations. Seven project trucks and several light vehicles were destroyed by LRA rebels who attacked the LWF/UNHCR compound in October 1996. The area is currently under UN security phase III having been reduced from phase IV in mid 1997. IV. ACT APPEAL GOAL And OBJECTIVES A. The project goal is to preserve, sustain and rehabilitate life and reduce the suffering of refugees, particularly vulnerable refugees, in Adjumani district whilst concurrently enabling them to become food self-sufficient and self-reliant in harmonious relations with the host community. B. Project Objectives to continue to meet the basic needs (foods, water, shelter, protection) of all refugees still in transit and all new refugee arrivals, to transfer and resettle the remaining 14,000 in the main transit camps and retransfer approx. 11,000 from unviable old settlements to productive settlements. to ensure that all refugee households in settlements have secure access to adequate cultivatable land to achieve and go beyond food self-sufficiency, to ensure all resettling refugees basic food needs are met through a combination of their own increasing production and decreasing relief food distributions, to develop basic infrastructural facilities such as health facilities, roads/bridges, etc., to jointly serve resettling refugees and the impacted national population, to ensure that all 54 light vehicles, 25 trucks, 60 motorcycles, 16 generators, boat engines, and heavy roads equipment utilised by LWF, UNHCR, Ministry of Local Government and partner NGOs under the project are effectively and efficiently maintained and repaired and that all UNHCR bulk provided fuel is properly managed and accounted for. to promote increased integration of service provision for refugees and nationals through capacity building of specific government departments and Local Councils. to promote the support of children at risk, unaccompanied minors, disabled and other vulnerable refugees by their respective communities and meet the specific needs of these particularly vulnerable refugees. to promote active refugee, and where feasible national community, participation in all project activities thereby contributing to longer term self-reliance, V. ACT APPEAL BENEFICIARIES Number & Type Of Your Targeted Beneficiaries As of 1 January 1998 the total refugee population in Adjumani district was 68,599. Of these 17,576 were in four transit camps, 114 unaccompanied minors were institutionalized in 3 unaccompanied minors centers (orphanages) and 50,909 were in 25 settlements scattered throughout the district. Of the latter some 16,500 were less than one year in settlement whilst only 1,974 had reached full food self-sufficiency. While about 40,000 of these presently in settlements should be able to achieve food self-sufficiency within the next 2 years, approx. 11,000 will have to be resettled in new settlements as the quantity/quality of land they have been allocated previously is insufficient. Almost 550 refugees are either physically or mentally disabled of whom 310 have either lost limbs or the use of them. Some 1,637 refugees are elderly living alone, as couples or with children under 18 years. Over 40% of families are female headed. The number of institutionalized unaccompanied minors has been reduced recently with the placement of 26 with suitable foster families and the phasing out of a further 92 who had reached the age of 18 from institutional care. All 68,599 Sudanese refugees presently in the district together with all new arrivals (estimated 1,000 - 3,000) during 1998 are targeted for general assistance. Unaccompanied minors, foster families, recently phased out unaccompanied minors, the disabled, the chronically ill, elderly living alone or with young children and particularly vulnerable female headed houses are targeted for specific assistance. The majority of refugees currently remaining in transit have been there for at least 5 years. The average family size in the transit camps is 2.64 but this may be significantly increased through intensive encouragement of family reunions (of the 21,642 refugees transferred from transits to settlements in 1997 the average family size was increased to 4.87). The majority of the refugees have an agricultural background with some being cattle herders and fishermen. A significant number of families have a few chickens, some have goats but very few have cattle. A significant number are from town areas and amongst these are traders and professionals in the medical, educational and technical fields. Ethnically, although 28 groups are represented, 44.6% are Madi, 32.8% are Kuku, 9.0% are Acholi, 5.0% are Dinka whilst the remaining 8% is composed of 24 tribal groups. The district’s national population is almost exclusively Madi. Demographically, 50.7% of the refugee population is male and the percentage of females only slightly exceeds males in the 18 years and over category. Approximately 20% of the population is under 5, 32% is aged 6-17 years and 47% is above 18. Criteria used in selecting beneficiaries: All refugees will continue to be provided general assistance (food, water, settlement infrastructure development, etc.) under the programme. Those targeted for specific assistance are selected according to their specific needs in line with UNHCR guidelines. Number of Targeted Beneficiaries According To Proposed Assistance 66,600 will continue to be provided monthly food rations with rates adjusted in accordance with periodic assessments of their own food-production. 14,000 in transit will continue to be provided a minimum of 20 ltrs of potable water per person/day (until they are transferred to new settlements). 25,000 will be provided adequate settlement land (0.3 ha per person) and a settlement kit per family (based on family size). Various infrastructure (roads, bridges, health facilities etc.) will be constructed/rehabilitated to meet the needs of the 25,000 being resettled/re-resettled in 1998 along with the 16,500 resettled in 1997. All disabled, unaccompanied minors, elderly living alone, in couples or with children under 10 years (pop 2,050) will be provided 5g salt and 20 grams sugar per person/day for he year. Sugar (5.2mton) and salt (0.57mton) will also be provided to Africa Humanitarian Action who are responsible for supplementary and therapeutic feeding. 4,850 vulnerable (disabled, unaccompanied minors, elderly with children, vulnerable female headed households) will be provided one bar of soap each per month during the year. 2,500 particularly vulnerable refugees will each be provided one set of used clothing. 20 particularly needy families lacking their own labour will be assisted to construct basic huts with community support. Approximately 200-250 physically disabled refugees will be provided items such as crutches, glasses, calipers, chairs wheelchair repair etc. Scholastic materials, tools, basic raw materials, and training as appropriate, will be provided to phasing-out-unaccompanied minors, disabled and other vulnerable whilst approximately 35 foster families will be provided limited material support as inducement/reward for looking after orphans. Training of refugee welfare committees and local council representatives should improve service delivery for all 68,600 refugees and the 85,500 nationals in the district. VI. PROPOSED EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE And IMPLEMENTATION A. Senior Programme Personnel : Life preserving, life sustaining While food is provided by WFP and funds have been made available from UNHCR for implementation of most of the general refugee assistance required, LWF/WS is responsible through its Field Coordinator and small team of specialised supervisory and support staff for ensuring that all primarily life sustaining assistance (food water, shelter, infrastructure etc.) is properly planned, managed and implemented. The most critical requirement therefore, is funds to pay salaries and related costs of the senior personnel required for implementing the programme. B. Houses to be repaired or reconstructed: Life preserving. The vast majority of refuges ie. new arrivals and those on transfers to settlements, are able to construct their own houses from local materials; bush poles, sun dried bricks and thatch. However, especially vulnerable refugees (disabled, elderly and infirm living alone or with minors) require material and labour assistance in this area. It is planned to assist up to 20 such families to construct their houses through community support. C. Food and/or nutritional assistance - Life preserving Although WFP is providing food for general distribution to refugees, sugar and salt has not been available for months and is most unlikely to be provided by them in the foreseeable future. Sugar and salt (20g and 5g respectively per person per day) is required during the year for approx. 2,050 vulnerable refugees (disabled, unaccompanied minor, elderly alone) whilst an additional 5.2 m tons sugar and 0.6m ton salt is required for therapeutic and supplementary feeding. D. Bedding and clothing - Life sustaining Approx. 2,500 sets of second hand clothing are required for unaccompanied minors, disabled/chronically ill and the elderly living alone or with minors. E. Soap - Life sustaining Although soap should be available from UNHCR for general distribution, in practice refugees have only been provided 3 pcs of soap each over the last 2 years. It is therefore planned to provide one piece of soap per month over the year to the disabled, unaccompanied minors, elderly with minors, and vulnerable female headed houses; a total population of some 4,850. F. Medical and related assistance - life rehabilitating A recent detailed refugee survey undertaken by LWF revealed a total of some 550 disabled/chronically ill refugees in Adjumani district. These included people who have lost arms and/or legs, have suffered partial paralysis (eg. through polio), have impaired hearing or sight and lepers. Although a number have wheelchairs many of these need repairs (eg. welding, tires etc.), while other refugees are in need of crutches, calipers, spectacles, etc. or such a basic items as a simple chair. G. Social/Community Services Support - life rehabilitating : A number of unaccompanied/potentially unaccompanied minors have been and will continue to be fostered out to relatives/neighbours/clan families as they preferred alternatives to institutional care. Small incentives (eg. clothing, additional food, etc) are required in support of such families. Protection cases also need to be supported while their case is being processed. Institutionalized unaccompanied minors have to leave their institution to join the general refugee population when they reach the age of 18 years. At this stage they need support to continue schooling (eg scholastic materials) or to start-up productive activities. Start up materials and training is also required by the disabled to undertake productive activities (eg. tools, raw materials, training). Refugee welfare committees members require training to become more active in managing their respective settlements. H. Service Integration/Capacity Building - life rehabilitating Both refugee welfare committee members and local level elected national leaders need training together in areas such as infrastructure maintenance (schools, roads, water facilities etc.), child rights, national laws, etc. This joint approach will also promote greater integration between refugees and the host national population. The new Adjumani district administration’s capacity and that of its four sub-county offices needs to be built up also to better enable them to plan and provide services for both nationals and resettling refugee. This will involve provision of basic furniture and office equipment, training on planning and budgeting, and assistance in undertaking surveys (including detailed administrative mapping down to the village level). VII. DESCRIPTION OF IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY A. Personnel Required: A total of 226 full time staff are required to plan, supervise, implement and monitor the local settlement programme for Sudanese refugees in Adjumani district during 1998. Of these some 219 are paid directly out of funds received by LWF from UNHCR and WFP. This appeal covers the salaries of the following full-time staff who are not covered under UNHCR and/or WFP funds; one Field Coordinator, (12 months) one Mechanical Workshop Manager (12 months), one Construction Manager (7 months), one Settlement Officer (10 months), one Assistant Social Services Coordinator (12 months), one Monitoring/Reporting Officer (12 month at 50%) and one Driver (12 months). An additional 14 LWF/DWS staff in Kampala are involved in providing logistics, programme and budget/finance support to the refugee settlement programme. B. Project Administration and Support requirements: At field level the programme is administered from the LWF Pakelle compound consisting of offices, mechanical workshop, carpentry workshop, warehouses, containers, fuel station, etc. A smaller office in Kampala provides administrative support. Some 8 light vehicles, 19 trucks, one tractor, 6 motorcycles and various pieces of heavy roads equipment currently enables LWF/WS to provide services to refugees. To improve the refugee data base and improve mechanical warehouse inventory control two new computers, printers and UPSs needs to be purchased whilst a recently donated HF radio-E-mail system needs to be licensed and installed to improve communications between the programme and LWF Kampala. Stationery, and reference materials for training, also need to be purchased. C. Transportation Requirements: Eight new 125cc motorcycles with helmets need to be purchased for field staff involved in the provision of social services/community development. As the Gulu-Pakelle road is quite insecure, charter flights need to be used regularly for personnel and urgent cargo transportation between Entebbe and Adjumani. Approx. 40 m ton materials under this appeal needs to be transported from Kampala to Pakelle by hired trucks. D. Procurement: Whilst most project materials and equipment required can be purchased locally at reasonable prices, motorcycles and computers with accessories will be purchased overseas and airfreighted to Entebbe to save costs. All procurement will be undertaken within the ACT procurement guidelines. E. Provision and implementation of assistance: LWF is responsible for direct implementation of the various programme sectors including food distribution, emergency water provision, transport and logistics, infrastructure development, settlement development, registration and many aspects of social services/community development programme manager. The programme’s Field Coordinator, with support from section heads with a range of technical expertise, manages the 226 full-time staff and 20 or so casual labourers employed on a daily basis throughout the year. VIII. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION, FINANCE, MONITORING, REPORTING A. Management and Administration: The LWF/WS Field Coordinator based in Pakelle is the overall manager of the programme. In this he is assisted by senior section heads responsible for settlement, mechanical workshop and construction whilst administrative support is provided by senior staff in administration, accounts and stores. The section heads in turn are supported by supervisors, assistant supervisors and foremen. The Field Coordinator will be responsible through the LWF Country Representative for the provision of narrative, statistical, financial and audit reports as specified in the ACT reporting guidelines. Financial and audit reports will be provided with the assistance of the LWF Uganda Finance Officer and the LWF Kampala accounts department. B. Monitoring: The Field Coordinator in conjunction with his section heads is responsible for monitoring all aspects of the programme. Regular monitoring is also undertaken by UNHCR, WFP and Ministry of Local Government. Monitoring is also undertaken through regular field visits by LWF Kampala based staff including the Representative, Monitoring/Reporting Officer, Finance Officer, Chief Accountant and other senior programme staff. C. Financial Management and Central: Funds will be disbursed and monitored by both the programme accountant in Pakelle and the LWF Accounts department in Kampala under supervision of the LWF Finance Officer in Kampala. IX. IMPLEMENTATION TIMETABLE Assessment, Start-up, Implementation, Close-out, Transition Project start-up date is 1 January 1998 with implementation throughout the year and close-out by 31 December 1998. X. COORDINATION Coordination with Other ACT Members No other ACT members are active in the district in refugee assistance. Established Coordination MechanismsCoordination among LWF, UNHCR, WFP, Ministry of Local Government, other NGO partners and Adjumani district departments is achieved through regular fortnightly meetings at the field level. Specific planning/coordination meetings are also chaired by UNHCR at field level on a very regular basis whilst coordination amongst UNHCR and its partners at national level is achieved through monthly meetings in Kampala. Coordination with Government:A refugee Desk Officer is responsible for coordination at the district level. He is assisted by a Camp Commandant and several deputies. The Desk Officer and Camp Commandant participate in all fortnightly general coordination meetings. At the national level the programme is formalised under an annual tripartite agreement between the Ministry of Local Government, UNHCR and LWF. LWF also has a signed agreement with WFP covering management and operation of Extended Delivery Points. XI GENERAL Additional InformationResettlement of refugees on adequate productive land to enable them to achieve food self sufficiency in the space of 2-3 years is an all too rare phenomenon in the late 1990s. Yet the Sudanese refugees population in Adjumani district have this opportunity, thanks to the generosity of the local population and the government of Uganda. The generally good relations that currently exist between the nationals and the resettling refugees can not be taken for granted - these have to be built upon by providing assistance to both the local national population as well as the refugees. In this context capacity building of local national structures is vitally important so that the provision of services to both refugees and nationals can be integrated as far as possible. XII.

","Appeal for Sudanese Refugees Resettlement Adjumani, UgandaSudanese Refugees Resettlement - AFUG 81 Appeal Target : US$ 361,000 Geneva, April 27, 1998 Dear Friends, The protracted civil war in Sudan has, since 1983, resulted in major influxes of refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries and, since mid-1986, there have been significant population displacements across the border into Uganda. Initially, transit camps were set up to deal with the regular onslaught of displaced persons and, since 1989, local settlements of refugees have been developed allowing the refugees to become more independent and self sufficient. As of end 1997, Adjumani, Uganda has a caseload of 68,599 displaced persons, with some 51,000 of these in the process of becoming established in local settlements. Food relief is no longer provided to four settlements where the refugees have become self sufficient, whilst in some camps the relief has been greatly reduced. But, all the remaining transit camps and the majority of settlements continue to be partly or fully dependent on food relief. Furthermore new refugee settlements are being developed in an area to the south of Adjumani, where communication and social infrastructure is very poor or non-existent. Lutheran World Federation/World Service (LWF/WS) working as UNHCR’s main partner, aims to provide refugee assistance in 4 transit camps and 25 local settlements. LWF/WS strives to meet the basic refugee needs of food, water, shelter and protection, aid the transition of those still in transit camps to local settlements and ensure that all refugee households have access to cultivatable land to help in their becoming self reliant and develop basic infrastructual and social facilities such as health, schooling, roads/bridges etc. ACT assistance is being requested to meet the basic life sustaining needs of those who have not yet attained food self sufficiency and self reliance in the Adjumani district and who, because of the continuing conflict in the Sudan cannot return to their pre-emergency lives. We thank you in advance for your support. Please kindly send your contributions to the ACT bank account.

II. IMPLEMENTING ACT MEMBER And PARTNER INFORMATION LWF/WS Uganda, as above III. DESCRIPTION Of The EMERGENCY SITUATION Type of emergency - Human madeThe protracted Sudanese Peoples Liberation Army - Government of Sudan civil war has resulted in major population displacements since 1983 and refugees fleeing across the border into northern Uganda from mid 1986 onwards. Major influxes were received into Moyo and Gulu districts in 1989, 1991 and again in 1994. The first of 3 adjacent transit camps was opened by UNHCR in Ogujebe on the east bank of the Albert Nile in 1986, on land provided by the Government of Uganda. In mid 1994 a fourth smaller transit camp was opened primarily for Dinka refugees some 30 km away near Adjumani town. Local settlement of refugees was begun in mid 1989 when the first of 25 relatively small settlements was developed in Adjumani district. A further local settlement began to be developed across the Nile in Moyo district in 1995. As of 31 December 1997 the total Sudanese refugee population in Adjumani district was 68,599, with a further 22,000 in the process of being resettled in Moyo district. Current Situation - Post Crisis PhaseOf the present refugee caseload of 68,599 in Adjumani district, some 51,000 are now in the process of becoming established in local settlements and the transit camp’s populations had been reduced to less that 17,600 by 31 December 1997, with a further 114 unaccompanied minors in institutional care. Food relief is no longer being provided in four settlements (pop. 1,974) where refugees have reached food self-sufficiency, cereal rations have been reduced to 50% in 8 settlements (pop. 8,090) whilst cereal rations have been cut by 20% in a further 3 settlements (pop. 5,958). Refugees in the more recent 10 settlements (pop 34,887) being developed together with the 17,690 refugees in transit camps and unaccompanied minor centers still require full food rations for survival. Date of emergency - 1 January - 31 December 1998It is extremely unlikely that the conditions of civil war and instability in south Sudan will improve in the short term. Furthermore, given the ethnic composition of the vast majority of Sudanese refugees in Adjumani districts, it is most unlikely that they will voluntarily repatriate to their home areas in the short term, even if the SPLA gain firm control of them. Location of emergency - Adjumani district (formerly East Moyo county, Moyo district) close to the Sudanese border in north-west Uganda. Refugees are located in 4 transit camps, and 25 local settlements scattered throughout the district. The district covers an area of some 3,300 sq. km with an estimated national population of some 85,500; the majority of whom were themselves refugees in South Sudan from 1980 - 86. The area suffered major infrastructual damage and decay in the post-Amin period, which has not yet been fully rehabilitated. The majority of the population is rural and primarily dependent on subsistence agriculture. Soil is moderately fertile with rainfall slightly above 1,000 mm in a bimodal pattern, two crops per annum can be produced. Adjumani town (pop. circa 2,500) is approx. 450km by road from Kampala but only accessible under military escort from Gulu. There are regular charter flights between Adjumani and Entebbe. Impact On Human LivesAll refugees in transit camps and the majority in local settlements are dependent on relief agencies for food, water, health and education services. Almost 11,000 of the 25,500 transferred to local settlements pre 1996 have insufficient cultivatable land to become food self-sufficient (many are little better off than they were in transit where no cultivatable land is available). The remaining 40,000 in local settlements should achieve food self-sufficiency within the next two years, while further settlements are being developed for the approx. 14,000 refugees remaining in the main transit camps together with 11,000 in unviable old settlements. This will still leave approximately 3,700, primarily Dinka refugees in transit as both the national population and local government authorities are unwilling to provide settlement land for them. Description of DamagesNew refugee settlements are primarily being developed in the now relatively sparsely inhabited south of the district, where communication and social infrastructure was either poorly developed or destroyed in the immediate post Amin period. As there is little that can be rehabilitated, resettlement calls for new basic infrastructure such as roads, bridges, schools, water supplies, health facilities, etc. to be constructed and maintained by the programme. New homes, latrines, etc. have to be constructed by the refugees themselves being transferred to settlements. Locations For ACT Appeal Response - Adjumani districtLWF/WS is involved in providing refugee assistance in all 4 transit camps and 25 local settlements in the district. As UNHCR’s main partner, LWF is responsible for multi-sectoral assistance including food distribution, transport and logistics (including central mechanical workshop operation) non-food item management, transit camp water operation and maintenance, settlement planning and development (including land demarcation, refugee transfer and settlement, roads/bridges and health facility construction), aspects of social services provision, refugee registration and general camp management. No less than five other international NGOs - ACORD, ACF, AHA, AEF and JRS are, under agreements with UNHCR, involved in the provision of agriculture/forestry, water development, health/sanitation and education assistance to refugees in the district. Food is being provided by World Food Programme to extended delivery points managed by LWF. Disaster and Emergency StatisticsLWF is responsible for refugee registration and recording population movements, and updated population and demographic data is provided on a monthly basis to UNHCR, government and partners organizations. There is no disagreement on figures. The last registration exercise was undertaken by UNHCR in collaboration with Government and LWF in October 1997. Current Security SituationThe district including local national and refugee settlements is subject to intermittent insecurity primarily caused by Lords Resistance Army rebels infiltrating from adjoining Gulu district. UNRF II and West Nile Bank Front rebels also occasionally cause insecurity incidents. All project supplies en route to Adjumani have to travel through war torn Gulu district under infrequent military escorts. LWF/WS staff coordinate closely with the Ugandan police and army and are in constant radio contact with them and all other partner organizations. Seven project trucks and several light vehicles were destroyed by LRA rebels who attacked the LWF/UNHCR compound in October 1996. The area is currently under UN security phase III having been reduced from phase IV in mid 1997. IV. ACT APPEAL GOAL And OBJECTIVES A. The project goal is to preserve, sustain and rehabilitate life and reduce the suffering of refugees, particularly vulnerable refugees, in Adjumani district whilst concurrently enabling them to become food self-sufficient and self-reliant in harmonious relations with the host community. B. Project Objectives to continue to meet the basic needs (foods, water, shelter, protection) of all refugees still in transit and all new refugee arrivals, to transfer and resettle the remaining 14,000 in the main transit camps and retransfer approx. 11,000 from unviable old settlements to productive settlements. to ensure that all refugee households in settlements have secure access to adequate cultivatable land to achieve and go beyond food self-sufficiency, to ensure all resettling refugees basic food needs are met through a combination of their own increasing production and decreasing relief food distributions, to develop basic infrastructural facilities such as health facilities, roads/bridges, etc., to jointly serve resettling refugees and the impacted national population, to ensure that all 54 light vehicles, 25 trucks, 60 motorcycles, 16 generators, boat engines, and heavy roads equipment utilised by LWF, UNHCR, Ministry of Local Government and partner NGOs under the project are effectively and efficiently maintained and repaired and that all UNHCR bulk provided fuel is properly managed and accounted for. to promote increased integration of service provision for refugees and nationals through capacity building of specific government departments and Local Councils. to promote the support of children at risk, unaccompanied minors, disabled and other vulnerable refugees by their respective communities and meet the specific needs of these particularly vulnerable refugees. to promote active refugee, and where feasible national community, participation in all project activities thereby contributing to longer term self-reliance, V. ACT APPEAL BENEFICIARIES Number & Type Of Your Targeted Beneficiaries As of 1 January 1998 the total refugee population in Adjumani district was 68,599. Of these 17,576 were in four transit camps, 114 unaccompanied minors were institutionalized in 3 unaccompanied minors centers (orphanages) and 50,909 were in 25 settlements scattered throughout the district. Of the latter some 16,500 were less than one year in settlement whilst only 1,974 had reached full food self-sufficiency. While about 40,000 of these presently in settlements should be able to achieve food self-sufficiency within the next 2 years, approx. 11,000 will have to be resettled in new settlements as the quantity/quality of land they have been allocated previously is insufficient. Almost 550 refugees are either physically or mentally disabled of whom 310 have either lost limbs or the use of them. Some 1,637 refugees are elderly living alone, as couples or with children under 18 years. Over 40% of families are female headed. The number of institutionalized unaccompanied minors has been reduced recently with the placement of 26 with suitable foster families and the phasing out of a further 92 who had reached the age of 18 from institutional care. All 68,599 Sudanese refugees presently in the district together with all new arrivals (estimated 1,000 - 3,000) during 1998 are targeted for general assistance. Unaccompanied minors, foster families, recently phased out unaccompanied minors, the disabled, the chronically ill, elderly living alone or with young children and particularly vulnerable female headed houses are targeted for specific assistance. The majority of refugees currently remaining in transit have been there for at least 5 years. The average family size in the transit camps is 2.64 but this may be significantly increased through intensive encouragement of family reunions (of the 21,642 refugees transferred from transits to settlements in 1997 the average family size was increased to 4.87). The majority of the refugees have an agricultural background with some being cattle herders and fishermen. A significant number of families have a few chickens, some have goats but very few have cattle. A significant number are from town areas and amongst these are traders and professionals in the medical, educational and technical fields. Ethnically, although 28 groups are represented, 44.6% are Madi, 32.8% are Kuku, 9.0% are Acholi, 5.0% are Dinka whilst the remaining 8% is composed of 24 tribal groups. The district’s national population is almost exclusively Madi. Demographically, 50.7% of the refugee population is male and the percentage of females only slightly exceeds males in the 18 years and over category. Approximately 20% of the population is under 5, 32% is aged 6-17 years and 47% is above 18. Criteria used in selecting beneficiaries: All refugees will continue to be provided general assistance (food, water, settlement infrastructure development, etc.) under the programme. Those targeted for specific assistance are selected according to their specific needs in line with UNHCR guidelines. Number of Targeted Beneficiaries According To Proposed Assistance 66,600 will continue to be provided monthly food rations with rates adjusted in accordance with periodic assessments of their own food-production. 14,000 in transit will continue to be provided a minimum of 20 ltrs of potable water per person/day (until they are transferred to new settlements). 25,000 will be provided adequate settlement land (0.3 ha per person) and a settlement kit per family (based on family size). Various infrastructure (roads, bridges, health facilities etc.) will be constructed/rehabilitated to meet the needs of the 25,000 being resettled/re-resettled in 1998 along with the 16,500 resettled in 1997. All disabled, unaccompanied minors, elderly living alone, in couples or with children under 10 years (pop 2,050) will be provided 5g salt and 20 grams sugar per person/day for he year. Sugar (5.2mton) and salt (0.57mton) will also be provided to Africa Humanitarian Action who are responsible for supplementary and therapeutic feeding. 4,850 vulnerable (disabled, unaccompanied minors, elderly with children, vulnerable female headed households) will be provided one bar of soap each per month during the year. 2,500 particularly vulnerable refugees will each be provided one set of used clothing. 20 particularly needy families lacking their own labour will be assisted to construct basic huts with community support. Approximately 200-250 physically disabled refugees will be provided items such as crutches, glasses, calipers, chairs wheelchair repair etc. Scholastic materials, tools, basic raw materials, and training as appropriate, will be provided to phasing-out-unaccompanied minors, disabled and other vulnerable whilst approximately 35 foster families will be provided limited material support as inducement/reward for looking after orphans. Training of refugee welfare committees and local council representatives should improve service delivery for all 68,600 refugees and the 85,500 nationals in the district. VI. PROPOSED EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE And IMPLEMENTATION A. Senior Programme Personnel : Life preserving, life sustaining While food is provided by WFP and funds have been made available from UNHCR for implementation of most of the general refugee assistance required, LWF/WS is responsible through its Field Coordinator and small team of specialised supervisory and support staff for ensuring that all primarily life sustaining assistance (food water, shelter, infrastructure etc.) is properly planned, managed and implemented. The most critical requirement therefore, is funds to pay salaries and related costs of the senior personnel required for implementing the programme. B. Houses to be repaired or reconstructed: Life preserving. The vast majority of refuges ie. new arrivals and those on transfers to settlements, are able to construct their own houses from local materials; bush poles, sun dried bricks and thatch. However, especially vulnerable refugees (disabled, elderly and infirm living alone or with minors) require material and labour assistance in this area. It is planned to assist up to 20 such families to construct their houses through community support. C. Food and/or nutritional assistance - Life preserving Although WFP is providing food for general distribution to refugees, sugar and salt has not been available for months and is most unlikely to be provided by them in the foreseeable future. Sugar and salt (20g and 5g respectively per person per day) is required during the year for approx. 2,050 vulnerable refugees (disabled, unaccompanied minor, elderly alone) whilst an additional 5.2 m tons sugar and 0.6m ton salt is required for therapeutic and supplementary feeding. D. Bedding and clothing - Life sustaining Approx. 2,500 sets of second hand clothing are required for unaccompanied minors, disabled/chronically ill and the elderly living alone or with minors. E. Soap - Life sustaining Although soap should be available from UNHCR for general distribution, in practice refugees have only been provided 3 pcs of soap each over the last 2 years. It is therefore planned to provide one piece of soap per month over the year to the disabled, unaccompanied minors, elderly with minors, and vulnerable female headed houses; a total population of some 4,850. F. Medical and related assistance - life rehabilitating A recent detailed refugee survey undertaken by LWF revealed a total of some 550 disabled/chronically ill refugees in Adjumani district. These included people who have lost arms and/or legs, have suffered partial paralysis (eg. through polio), have impaired hearing or sight and lepers. Although a number have wheelchairs many of these need repairs (eg. welding, tires etc.), while other refugees are in need of crutches, calipers, spectacles, etc. or such a basic items as a simple chair. G. Social/Community Services Support - life rehabilitating : A number of unaccompanied/potentially unaccompanied minors have been and will continue to be fostered out to relatives/neighbours/clan families as they preferred alternatives to institutional care. Small incentives (eg. clothing, additional food, etc) are required in support of such families. Protection cases also need to be supported while their case is being processed. Institutionalized unaccompanied minors have to leave their institution to join the general refugee population when they reach the age of 18 years. At this stage they need support to continue schooling (eg scholastic materials) or to start-up productive activities. Start up materials and training is also required by the disabled to undertake productive activities (eg. tools, raw materials, training). Refugee welfare committees members require training to become more active in managing their respective settlements. H. Service Integration/Capacity Building - life rehabilitating Both refugee welfare committee members and local level elected national leaders need training together in areas such as infrastructure maintenance (schools, roads, water facilities etc.), child rights, national laws, etc. This joint approach will also promote greater integration between refugees and the host national population. The new Adjumani district administration’s capacity and that of its four sub-county offices needs to be built up also to better enable them to plan and provide services for both nationals and resettling refugee. This will involve provision of basic furniture and office equipment, training on planning and budgeting, and assistance in undertaking surveys (including detailed administrative mapping down to the village level). VII. DESCRIPTION OF IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY A. Personnel Required: A total of 226 full time staff are required to plan, supervise, implement and monitor the local settlement programme for Sudanese refugees in Adjumani district during 1998. Of these some 219 are paid directly out of funds received by LWF from UNHCR and WFP. This appeal covers the salaries of the following full-time staff who are not covered under UNHCR and/or WFP funds; one Field Coordinator, (12 months) one Mechanical Workshop Manager (12 months), one Construction Manager (7 months), one Settlement Officer (10 months), one Assistant Social Services Coordinator (12 months), one Monitoring/Reporting Officer (12 month at 50%) and one Driver (12 months). An additional 14 LWF/DWS staff in Kampala are involved in providing logistics, programme and budget/finance support to the refugee settlement programme. B. Project Administration and Support requirements: At field level the programme is administered from the LWF Pakelle compound consisting of offices, mechanical workshop, carpentry workshop, warehouses, containers, fuel station, etc. A smaller office in Kampala provides administrative support. Some 8 light vehicles, 19 trucks, one tractor, 6 motorcycles and various pieces of heavy roads equipment currently enables LWF/WS to provide services to refugees. To improve the refugee data base and improve mechanical warehouse inventory control two new computers, printers and UPSs needs to be purchased whilst a recently donated HF radio-E-mail system needs to be licensed and installed to improve communications between the programme and LWF Kampala. Stationery, and reference materials for training, also need to be purchased. C. Transportation Requirements: Eight new 125cc motorcycles with helmets need to be purchased for field staff involved in the provision of social services/community development. As the Gulu-Pakelle road is quite insecure, charter flights need to be used regularly for personnel and urgent cargo transportation between Entebbe and Adjumani. Approx. 40 m ton materials under this appeal needs to be transported from Kampala to Pakelle by hired trucks. D. Procurement: Whilst most project materials and equipment required can be purchased locally at reasonable prices, motorcycles and computers with accessories will be purchased overseas and airfreighted to Entebbe to save costs. All procurement will be undertaken within the ACT procurement guidelines. E. Provision and implementation of assistance: LWF is responsible for direct implementation of the various programme sectors including food distribution, emergency water provision, transport and logistics, infrastructure development, settlement development, registration and many aspects of social services/community development programme manager. The programme’s Field Coordinator, with support from section heads with a range of technical expertise, manages the 226 full-time staff and 20 or so casual labourers employed on a daily basis throughout the year. VIII. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION, FINANCE, MONITORING, REPORTING A. Management and Administration: The LWF/WS Field Coordinator based in Pakelle is the overall manager of the programme. In this he is assisted by senior section heads responsible for settlement, mechanical workshop and construction whilst administrative support is provided by senior staff in administration, accounts and stores. The section heads in turn are supported by supervisors, assistant supervisors and foremen. The Field Coordinator will be responsible through the LWF Country Representative for the provision of narrative, statistical, financial and audit reports as specified in the ACT reporting guidelines. Financial and audit reports will be provided with the assistance of the LWF Uganda Finance Officer and the LWF Kampala accounts department. B. Monitoring: The Field Coordinator in conjunction with his section heads is responsible for monitoring all aspects of the programme. Regular monitoring is also undertaken by UNHCR, WFP and Ministry of Local Government. Monitoring is also undertaken through regular field visits by LWF Kampala based staff including the Representative, Monitoring/Reporting Officer, Finance Officer, Chief Accountant and other senior programme staff. C. Financial Management and Central: Funds will be disbursed and monitored by both the programme accountant in Pakelle and the LWF Accounts department in Kampala under supervision of the LWF Finance Officer in Kampala. IX. IMPLEMENTATION TIMETABLE Assessment, Start-up, Implementation, Close-out, Transition Project start-up date is 1 January 1998 with implementation throughout the year and close-out by 31 December 1998. X. COORDINATION Coordination with Other ACT Members No other ACT members are active in the district in refugee assistance. Established Coordination MechanismsCoordination among LWF, UNHCR, WFP, Ministry of Local Government, other NGO partners and Adjumani district departments is achieved through regular fortnightly meetings at the field level. Specific planning/coordination meetings are also chaired by UNHCR at field level on a very regular basis whilst coordination amongst UNHCR and its partners at national level is achieved through monthly meetings in Kampala. Coordination with Government:A refugee Desk Officer is responsible for coordination at the district level. He is assisted by a Camp Commandant and several deputies. The Desk Officer and Camp Commandant participate in all fortnightly general coordination meetings. At the national level the programme is formalised under an annual tripartite agreement between the Ministry of Local Government, UNHCR and LWF. LWF also has a signed agreement with WFP covering management and operation of Extended Delivery Points. XI GENERAL Additional InformationResettlement of refugees on adequate productive land to enable them to achieve food self sufficiency in the space of 2-3 years is an all too rare phenomenon in the late 1990s. Yet the Sudanese refugees population in Adjumani district have this opportunity, thanks to the generosity of the local population and the government of Uganda. The generally good relations that currently exist between the nationals and the resettling refugees can not be taken for granted - these have to be built upon by providing assistance to both the local national population as well as the refugees. In this context capacity building of local national structures is vitally important so that the provision of services to both refugees and nationals can be integrated as far as possible. XII.

166,37053,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Appeal for Kakuma Refugee Assistance Program,"Kakuma Refugee Assistance Program AFKE83Appeal Target : US$ 2,814,206 Request from ACT Network : US$ 399,206 Geneva, April 27, 1998 Dear Colleagues, The ongoing civil war in southern Sudan has over the years resulted in mass exodus of southern Sudanese people into neighboring countries. Following an influx of around 30,000 asylum seekers into northern Kenya in 1992, the Government of Kenya (GoK) provided a site in Kakuma, north-west Kenya, to house the refugees. A large majority of the 55,000 refugees currently in Kakuma camp, are of Sudanese origin. Others include Somalis, Ethiopians, Ugandans, Congolese, Rwandese and Burundese. Under a tripartite agreement with the UNHCR and GoK, the Lutheran World Federation / Department of World Service (LWF/DWS) has been responsible for camp management which includes distribution of food and non-food items, maintenance and operation of water systems, sanitation, shelter construction, education, social services, counseling, construction and maintenance of camp infrastructure and camp security coordination. LWF/DWS also provides transport and other assistance to other ACT members operating in the camp - the New Sudan Council of Churches, Church of the Province of Kenya, the Presbyterian Church and others. It is extremely unlikely that conditions of civil war and instability in Sudan and Somalia will improve in the short term. The camp was started in 1992 and seems likely to continue through 1998 and beyond. ACT is a worldwide network of churches and related agencies meeting human need through coordinated emergency response. The ACT Coordinating Office is based with the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) in Switzerland. Under the tripartite agreement, of the total US $ 2.8 million required for Kakuma camp in 1998, UNHCR will provide LWF/DWS with US $ 1.8 million (64 %) of the total budget. In addition, Lutheran World Relief - USA has secured US $ 615,000 from the US State Department Bureau for Population, Refugees and Migration. The balance of around US $ 400,000 is being sought from the ACT Network. This will enable ACT-LWF/DWS to meet the basic life sustaining needs of the refugees who are unable to return to their pre-emergency homes and lives. Thank you for your support. Please kindly send your contributions to the ACT bank account. For further information, please contact: ACT Co-ordinator, Miriam Lutz (phone 41 22 791 6032 or mobile phone ++ 41 89 203 6055)or ACT Appeals Officer, Neville Pradhan (phone +41 22 791 6035) ACT Web Site address: http://www.wcc-coe.org/act/   Rev.

Lutheran World Federation/Department of World Service, Nairobi, Kenya Contact: Mr Jim Mason, Programme Co-ordinator Tel: (254-2) 56 09 63/56 46 59 Fax: (254-2) 56 50 41 e-mail: lwfnairobi@maf.org B. LWF/DWS Nairobi office has been undertaking emergency operations in the East African region since 1973. Logistics support has been provided for relief and rehabilitation programs in southern Sudan, Somalia, Rwanda and Zaire. The Nairobi office has also given assistance to LWF/DWS development programs in Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania. II. IMPLEMENTING ACT MEMBER and PARTNER INFORMATION LWF/DWS Nairobi as above. III. DESCRIPTION of the EMERGENCY SITUATION Type of emergency - human made: In July 1992, southern Sudanese refugees fleeing the ongoing civil war between the Government of Sudan and the Sudanese Peoples’ Liberation Army sought asylum in Kenya. An influx of about 30,000 asylum seekers crossed into northern Kenya at Lokchokio. A permanent site at Kakuma was provided by the Government of Kenya (GoK) further away from the border in Turkana district of north-west Kenya. The current camp population is about 55,000 and the big majority of these refugees are south Sudanese of several ethnic groups. The population profile has changed with the relocation of refugees of other nationalities as other refugee camps in Kenya are closed. Nationalities now include Somalis, Ethiopians, Ugandans, Congolese, Rwandese and Burundians. Current phase of emergency - post crisis phase: ACT assistance is sought for basic life-sustaining needs of the refugees who are unable to return to their pre-emergency homes and lives. Date of emergency - January to December 1998: It is extremely unlikely that conditions of civil war and instability in Sudan and Somalia will improve in the short term. The camp started in 1992 and seems likely to continue throughout 1998 and beyond. Impact on human lives: All the refugees in Kakuma camp are totally reliant on relief agencies for supply of food, water, shelter, health, sanitation and other services. It is not possible for the refugees to practice agriculture or pastoralism -their usual livelihoods as land and water resources are inadequate and cannot sustain these activities. Of the 55,000 refugees in the camp, there is a high proportion of children and teenagers. There are about 8,000 unaccompanied minors included in the school population of 18,000 students. Damage to property: Every year the camp continues to operate, there is a need to repair and maintain camp infrastructure. In 1998 resources are needed for building 2,000 new shelters and 500 new latrines as well as maintenance of 22 schools, 20 kilometres of water pipes and roads along with numerous camp buildings and community structures. Location of emergency and of proposed response - Kakuma, Kenya in Turkana district of north-west Kenya, some 100 kilometres south of the Sudan border and 900 kilometres by road from Nairobi. It is a hot and dry area of shrub and sand with low and unpredictable annual rainfall. Other agencies are collaborating with LWF/DWS in the operation of Kakuma refugee camp. UNHCR provides much of the funding for NGO programs in the camp and monitors NGO expenditures. Other partners include the WFP which is responsible for the provision and storage of food commodities and the IRC which is in charge of the medical sector and some self-help activities. LWF/DWS works in partnership with Don Bosco Vocational Training who have seconded staff from Jesuit Refugee Services to assist in social services. The National Council of Churches of Kenya and the Kenya Girl Guides also combine with LWF/DWS to promote their activities in the camp. Statistics: There is general agreement between LWF/DWS, GoK and UNHCR on camp population figures. A camp census was conducted by UNHCR in August 1997 with participation by GoK and LWF/DWS staff. Arrivals and departures from the camp are registered by UNHCR. Current security situation: Bandit attacks are an irregular feature of road travel in Turkana district. It is therefore advisable to travel in convoy when journeying from Kakuma to Nairobi. In the camp, LWF/DWS works with GoK police to ensure security. Robbery and fighting are the most common offences in the camp, with an occasional gun or hand grenade attack. However, report of refugees assaulting staff are infrequent and NGO staff do not usually work under any physical threat. IV. GOAL and OBJECTIVES A. Project goal: To preserve and sustain life and reduce suffering of refugees at Kakuma camp, while concurrently fostering preparation for their future lives. B. Project objectives:  Orderly distribution of food and non-food items to the camp population. Capacity-building for greater refugee participation in the planning and implementation of camp programs. Support for community social activities and projects. Provision of essential camp infrastructure - shelters, water supply, sanitation, flood and environmental protection, road-works and construction of community buildings. Developing an appropriate environment for youth, unaccompanied minors and others and preparation for eventual repatriation. Effective operation of the education sector - secondary, primary and pre-schools. Promotion of peace education, conflict resolution and development of social and vocational skills. Improvement and enhancement of social and cultural ties amongst the various nationalities and ethnic groupings. Developing a co-ordinated approach to the provision of assistance to the target population with UNHCR, GoK and other partners.  V. BENEFICIARIES A. Number & Type of Targeted Beneficiaries: Some 55,000 refugees at Kakuma camp will benefit from the implementation of LWF/DWS Refugee Assistance Program. Of the 55,000 people in the camp, around 35,000 are from southern Sudan, some 10,000 are Somalis, and the remainder come from Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Democratic Republic of Congo. Much less than half of the camp population is female - only 38% of the refugees are women or girls. There is a disproportionately high number of male youths in the camp. As many as 8,000 unaccompanied boys settled in the camp when it opened in 1992. Currently, around 5,000 boys and a further 3,000 vulnerable minors require special psycho-social assistance. B. Selection Criteria: The targeted refugees and families are especially vulnerable because they have lost their homes, livelihoods and citizen rights. At Kakuma camp, assistance is given to all refugees registered by UNHCR. C. Number of Beneficiaries by Type of Relief: All the refugees are entitled to receive food, water, firewood, shelter, sanitation, health and social services. Some special services are available to vulnerable groups within the refugee community. Girl children are encouraged to attend school, and LWF/DWS Social Services Department conducts special programs for women. Activities are also undertaken with the disabled. VI. PROPOSED EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE and IMPLEMENTATION The proposed relief measures can be categorised as life sustaining, i.e. required to provide basic life needs. Houses to be constructed/repaired - this year there is a need to repair as many as 4,000 shelters that have deteriorated or been destroyed by extremes of weather or by fire or flood. For new arrivals there will be a need to build around 2,000 new shelters. Water - the maintenance and expansion of the camp water supply requires skilled personnel to ensure that each refugee receives 22 litres of clean water per day. Sanitation - to maintain camp hygiene standards and reduce the risk of disease it is proposed to build 500 new latrines and 1,200 latrine superstructures during 1998. This will require purchase of cement, sand, wood poles and palm leaves- for roofing. Community infrastructure - the LWF/DWS office in the camp needs to be extended to allow for accommodation of three sector heads currently without dedicated office space. With about 1,500 students undertaking secondary school studies there is urgent need to enlarge the main library in the camp. The increasing range of LWF/DWS social service programs and activities requires construction of two new social service centres. Community services - a program of special services for women addresses their special needs and mobilises women into groups for various production and capacity building activities. The Community Development program also focuses on capacity building and income generation for such vulnerable groups as the disabled, the aged and youth. The Social Services department also focuses on the cultural, recreational and sports needs of the refugee community. VII. PROJECT MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION and MONITORING Management and administration: LWF/DWS senior management including the Program Coordinator and Camp Manager liaise closely with UNHCR and other operational agencies in planning and designing the overall program. The Program Coordinator will provide ACT Geneva with narrative, statistical, financial and audit reports as specified in the Reporting Guidelines. Monitoring: Project assessment is undertaken with regular monitoring and evaluation by UNHCR together with scheduled reporting as stipulated in the project agreement between LWF/DWS and UNHCR. LWF/DWS however operates an independent monitoring and evaluation system to cross-check the effectiveness of the program and control the use of project resources. Financial management and controls: Funds will be disbursed and expenditures monitored by LWF/DWS Accounts Departments in Nairobi. Personnel required: Some 280 Kenyan staff (plus 1,000 refugee workers) are required in Kakuma to implement the LWF/DWS program of assistance for the 55,000 refugees in the camp. Another 10 LWF/DWS staff in Nairobi provide logistic, program and budget/finance support. Project administration and support: A large office in Kakuma camp and a smaller office in Nairobi provide the administrative support for the LWF/DWS Refugee Assistance Program. Some 17 light vehicles in Kakuma and Nairobi and four trucks and two tractors in Kakuma enable the LWF/DWS staff to provide services to the refugees in the camp. Transportation requirements: There is need to purchase another 14 MT truck and one pick-up to help transport firewood and supplementary food (fruits and vegetables) for the refugees. In addition, LWF/DWS charters flights from Nairobi to Kakuma on a fort-nightly basis for carriage of staff and essential supplies. Procurement of vehicles and other capital equipment: This can be done in Nairobi by the LWF/DWS Logistics and Liaison office. The main function of the office is to provide support for Kakuma camp. As per ACT procurement guidelines, all purchases of equipment worth more than $5000 will need three price quotations. Implementation: LWF/DWS employs an expatriate camp manager to lead a team of 10 Kenyan coordinators for the different sectors of camp activities. In turn, the coordinators are assisted by the 280 Kenyan staff members and by 1000 refugee workers. VIII. IMPLEMENTATION TIMETABLE Assessment, start-up, implementation, close-out, transition: Project start date is 1 January 1998 with implementation throughout the year and close-out by 31 December 1998. IX. COORDINATION Co-ordination with other ACT members: The Church of the Province of Kenya (Anglican), Presbyterian and other churches operate in the refugee camp, but are not active in relief work. From time to time, LWF/DWS supports the ACT member churches including the New Sudan Council of Churches, with transport and other assistance. Established co-ordination mechanisms: LWF/DWS annually renews a tripartite agreement with UNHCR and the Government of Kenya to manage the camp. Regular coordination meetings are held in the camp and in Nairobi with staff from LWF/DWS, UNHCR and partner NGOs. Co-ordination with government: The GoK provides safe asylum for refugees by giving security support for camp operations. A District Officer and a police post are stationed in the camp. X. GENERAL Normal life-sustaining activities of agriculture and pastoralism are not possible for the refugee population as such activities would lead to competition for use of scarce natural resources of water and grazing land with the local Turkana people. LWF/DWS focuses on education (including conflict resolution, peace education, environmental awareness, homeland education and gender sensitivity) and social services (sports, drama, small enterprises, women’s programs, etc.) to give refugees alternative activities. Such programs can reduce tension in the camp and minimize violence within and among communities of various ethnic groups. XI.

LWF/DWS Nairobi office has been undertaking emergency operations in the East African region since 1973. Logistics support has been provided for relief and rehabilitation programs in southern Sudan, Somalia, Rwanda and Zaire. The Nairobi office has also given assistance to LWF/DWS development programs in Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania. II. IMPLEMENTING ACT MEMBER and PARTNER INFORMATION LWF/DWS Nairobi as above. III. DESCRIPTION of the EMERGENCY SITUATION Type of emergency - human made: In July 1992, southern Sudanese refugees fleeing the ongoing civil war between the Government of Sudan and the Sudanese Peoples’ Liberation Army sought asylum in Kenya. An influx of about 30,000 asylum seekers crossed into northern Kenya at Lokchokio. A permanent site at Kakuma was provided by the Government of Kenya (GoK) further away from the border in Turkana district of north-west Kenya. The current camp population is about 55,000 and the big majority of these refugees are south Sudanese of several ethnic groups. The population profile has changed with the relocation of refugees of other nationalities as other refugee camps in Kenya are closed. Nationalities now include Somalis, Ethiopians, Ugandans, Congolese, Rwandese and Burundians. Current phase of emergency - post crisis phase: ACT assistance is sought for basic life-sustaining needs of the refugees who are unable to return to their pre-emergency homes and lives. Date of emergency - January to December 1998: It is extremely unlikely that conditions of civil war and instability in Sudan and Somalia will improve in the short term. The camp started in 1992 and seems likely to continue throughout 1998 and beyond. Impact on human lives: All the refugees in Kakuma camp are totally reliant on relief agencies for supply of food, water, shelter, health, sanitation and other services. It is not possible for the refugees to practice agriculture or pastoralism -their usual livelihoods as land and water resources are inadequate and cannot sustain these activities. Of the 55,000 refugees in the camp, there is a high proportion of children and teenagers. There are about 8,000 unaccompanied minors included in the school population of 18,000 students. Damage to property: Every year the camp continues to operate, there is a need to repair and maintain camp infrastructure. In 1998 resources are needed for building 2,000 new shelters and 500 new latrines as well as maintenance of 22 schools, 20 kilometres of water pipes and roads along with numerous camp buildings and community structures. Location of emergency and of proposed response - Kakuma, Kenya in Turkana district of north-west Kenya, some 100 kilometres south of the Sudan border and 900 kilometres by road from Nairobi. It is a hot and dry area of shrub and sand with low and unpredictable annual rainfall. Other agencies are collaborating with LWF/DWS in the operation of Kakuma refugee camp. UNHCR provides much of the funding for NGO programs in the camp and monitors NGO expenditures. Other partners include the WFP which is responsible for the provision and storage of food commodities and the IRC which is in charge of the medical sector and some self-help activities. LWF/DWS works in partnership with Don Bosco Vocational Training who have seconded staff from Jesuit Refugee Services to assist in social services. The National Council of Churches of Kenya and the Kenya Girl Guides also combine with LWF/DWS to promote their activities in the camp. Statistics: There is general agreement between LWF/DWS, GoK and UNHCR on camp population figures. A camp census was conducted by UNHCR in August 1997 with participation by GoK and LWF/DWS staff. Arrivals and departures from the camp are registered by UNHCR. Current security situation: Bandit attacks are an irregular feature of road travel in Turkana district. It is therefore advisable to travel in convoy when journeying from Kakuma to Nairobi. In the camp, LWF/DWS works with GoK police to ensure security. Robbery and fighting are the most common offences in the camp, with an occasional gun or hand grenade attack. However, report of refugees assaulting staff are infrequent and NGO staff do not usually work under any physical threat. IV. GOAL and OBJECTIVES A. Project goal: To preserve and sustain life and reduce suffering of refugees at Kakuma camp, while concurrently fostering preparation for their future lives. B. Project objectives:  Orderly distribution of food and non-food items to the camp population. Capacity-building for greater refugee participation in the planning and implementation of camp programs. Support for community social activities and projects. Provision of essential camp infrastructure - shelters, water supply, sanitation, flood and environmental protection, road-works and construction of community buildings. Developing an appropriate environment for youth, unaccompanied minors and others and preparation for eventual repatriation. Effective operation of the education sector - secondary, primary and pre-schools. Promotion of peace education, conflict resolution and development of social and vocational skills. Improvement and enhancement of social and cultural ties amongst the various nationalities and ethnic groupings. Developing a co-ordinated approach to the provision of assistance to the target population with UNHCR, GoK and other partners.  V. BENEFICIARIES A. Number & Type of Targeted Beneficiaries: Some 55,000 refugees at Kakuma camp will benefit from the implementation of LWF/DWS Refugee Assistance Program. Of the 55,000 people in the camp, around 35,000 are from southern Sudan, some 10,000 are Somalis, and the remainder come from Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Democratic Republic of Congo. Much less than half of the camp population is female - only 38% of the refugees are women or girls. There is a disproportionately high number of male youths in the camp. As many as 8,000 unaccompanied boys settled in the camp when it opened in 1992. Currently, around 5,000 boys and a further 3,000 vulnerable minors require special psycho-social assistance. B. Selection Criteria: The targeted refugees and families are especially vulnerable because they have lost their homes, livelihoods and citizen rights. At Kakuma camp, assistance is given to all refugees registered by UNHCR. C. Number of Beneficiaries by Type of Relief: All the refugees are entitled to receive food, water, firewood, shelter, sanitation, health and social services. Some special services are available to vulnerable groups within the refugee community. Girl children are encouraged to attend school, and LWF/DWS Social Services Department conducts special programs for women. Activities are also undertaken with the disabled. VI. PROPOSED EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE and IMPLEMENTATION The proposed relief measures can be categorised as life sustaining, i.e. required to provide basic life needs. Houses to be constructed/repaired - this year there is a need to repair as many as 4,000 shelters that have deteriorated or been destroyed by extremes of weather or by fire or flood. For new arrivals there will be a need to build around 2,000 new shelters. Water - the maintenance and expansion of the camp water supply requires skilled personnel to ensure that each refugee receives 22 litres of clean water per day. Sanitation - to maintain camp hygiene standards and reduce the risk of disease it is proposed to build 500 new latrines and 1,200 latrine superstructures during 1998. This will require purchase of cement, sand, wood poles and palm leaves- for roofing. Community infrastructure - the LWF/DWS office in the camp needs to be extended to allow for accommodation of three sector heads currently without dedicated office space. With about 1,500 students undertaking secondary school studies there is urgent need to enlarge the main library in the camp. The increasing range of LWF/DWS social service programs and activities requires construction of two new social service centres. Community services - a program of special services for women addresses their special needs and mobilises women into groups for various production and capacity building activities. The Community Development program also focuses on capacity building and income generation for such vulnerable groups as the disabled, the aged and youth. The Social Services department also focuses on the cultural, recreational and sports needs of the refugee community. VII. PROJECT MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION and MONITORING Management and administration: LWF/DWS senior management including the Program Coordinator and Camp Manager liaise closely with UNHCR and other operational agencies in planning and designing the overall program. The Program Coordinator will provide ACT Geneva with narrative, statistical, financial and audit reports as specified in the Reporting Guidelines. Monitoring: Project assessment is undertaken with regular monitoring and evaluation by UNHCR together with scheduled reporting as stipulated in the project agreement between LWF/DWS and UNHCR. LWF/DWS however operates an independent monitoring and evaluation system to cross-check the effectiveness of the program and control the use of project resources. Financial management and controls: Funds will be disbursed and expenditures monitored by LWF/DWS Accounts Departments in Nairobi. Personnel required: Some 280 Kenyan staff (plus 1,000 refugee workers) are required in Kakuma to implement the LWF/DWS program of assistance for the 55,000 refugees in the camp. Another 10 LWF/DWS staff in Nairobi provide logistic, program and budget/finance support. Project administration and support: A large office in Kakuma camp and a smaller office in Nairobi provide the administrative support for the LWF/DWS Refugee Assistance Program. Some 17 light vehicles in Kakuma and Nairobi and four trucks and two tractors in Kakuma enable the LWF/DWS staff to provide services to the refugees in the camp. Transportation requirements: There is need to purchase another 14 MT truck and one pick-up to help transport firewood and supplementary food (fruits and vegetables) for the refugees. In addition, LWF/DWS charters flights from Nairobi to Kakuma on a fort-nightly basis for carriage of staff and essential supplies. Procurement of vehicles and other capital equipment: This can be done in Nairobi by the LWF/DWS Logistics and Liaison office. The main function of the office is to provide support for Kakuma camp. As per ACT procurement guidelines, all purchases of equipment worth more than $5000 will need three price quotations. Implementation: LWF/DWS employs an expatriate camp manager to lead a team of 10 Kenyan coordinators for the different sectors of camp activities. In turn, the coordinators are assisted by the 280 Kenyan staff members and by 1000 refugee workers. VIII. IMPLEMENTATION TIMETABLE Assessment, start-up, implementation, close-out, transition: Project start date is 1 January 1998 with implementation throughout the year and close-out by 31 December 1998. IX. COORDINATION Co-ordination with other ACT members: The Church of the Province of Kenya (Anglican), Presbyterian and other churches operate in the refugee camp, but are not active in relief work. From time to time, LWF/DWS supports the ACT member churches including the New Sudan Council of Churches, with transport and other assistance. Established co-ordination mechanisms: LWF/DWS annually renews a tripartite agreement with UNHCR and the Government of Kenya to manage the camp. Regular coordination meetings are held in the camp and in Nairobi with staff from LWF/DWS, UNHCR and partner NGOs. Co-ordination with government: The GoK provides safe asylum for refugees by giving security support for camp operations. A District Officer and a police post are stationed in the camp. X. GENERAL Normal life-sustaining activities of agriculture and pastoralism are not possible for the refugee population as such activities would lead to competition for use of scarce natural resources of water and grazing land with the local Turkana people. LWF/DWS focuses on education (including conflict resolution, peace education, environmental awareness, homeland education and gender sensitivity) and social services (sports, drama, small enterprises, women’s programs, etc.) to give refugees alternative activities. Such programs can reduce tension in the camp and minimize violence within and among communities of various ethnic groups. XI.

168,37180,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,CWS/ACT appeal: Sudan refugee resettlement,"CHURCH WORLD SERVICE EMERGENCY RESPONSE OFFICE 34 Denominations & Communions Working Together to Meet Human Needs CWS/ACT APPEAL: SUDAN REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT (#976309) (In support of ACT Appeal #AFUG81 for $361,000) SITUATION: Large numbers of refugees have fled Sudan during the last 15 years of a protracted civil war between the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Army and the government of Sudan. Many of the refugees have settled in neighboring Uganda. Recent tensions in Sudan have once again caused migrations into Uganda. Transit camps there were initially established to accommodate large numbers of displaced persons. Since 1989, local refugee settlements have developed, allowing the refugees to become more independent and self-sufficient. One of those camps, in Adjumani, Uganda, has a caseload of 68,600 displaced persons, with some 51,000 in the process of becoming established in local settlements. All refugees in transit camps and the majority in local settlements are dependent on relief agencies for food, water, health and education services. RESPONSE: Through Action by Churches Together (ACT) International, Lutheran World Federation/World Service, working as a partner with UNHCR, seeks to provide refugee assistance in four transit camps and 25 local settlements. As UNHCR's main partner, LWF is responsible for food distribution, transport and logistics, non-food item management, transit camp water operation and maintenance, settlement planning and development, refugee registration and general camp management. Food is being provided by the World Food Program to extended delivery points managed by LWF. LWF/WS seeks to meet the basic refugee needs of food, water, shelter and protection; aid the transition of those still in transit camps to local settlements; and ensure that all refugee households have access to cultivatable land to help them become self reliant and develop basic facilities such as health clinics, schools and roads. ACT assistance is being requested to meet the basic needs of those in the Adjumani district who have not yet become self sufficient and who, because of the continuing conflict, cannot return to Sudan. The goal of this appeal is to preserve, sustain and rehabilitate life and reduce the suffering of refugees, particularly vulnerable refugees, in the Adjumani district while also enabling them to become self-sufficient and self-reliant. APPEAL SPECIFICS: LWF seeks to assist all 68,600 refugees in the region, with unaccompanied minors, foster families, the disabled, the chronically ill, elderly living alone or with young children and vulnerable women being targeted for specific assistance. Most refugees will continue to receive food rations; those in transit -- some 14,000 -- will also continue to receive a minimum of 20 liters of potable water daily until they are transferred to new settlements. Small parcels of settlement land and settlement kits will be provided to new settlers, and new infrastructure of roads, bridges and health facilities will be constructed. Other material assistance will also be provided. IMPLEMENTATION TIMETABLE: The project is expected to be completed by Dec. 31, 1998. BUDGET: The total amount of the program is $5.37 million. Confirmed donor support from UNHCR and the World Food Program is $1.72 million; in-kind support from UNHCR and the World Food Program is $3.29 million. The request to the ACT network is $361,000 and includes the following budget: Assistance, including food: $19,840 Shelter, health supplies: $31,398 Rehabilitation: $8,018 Local training, capacity building: $36,040 Transport, storage: $3,894 Capitol equipment $41,214 Personnel: $171,382 Staff Travel: $10,378 Vehicle, communications: $36,314 Other: $2,530 TOTAL APPEAL EXPENSES: $361,000 HOW TO HELP: CWS is supporting this appeal and will channel funds to ACT.

169,37665,[4589],Contributions,Russian Federation Yakutia Floods - OCHA Appeal for International Assistance,"Ref: OCHAGVA - 98/0226 General Situation Floods caused by melting snow in eastern Russia have claimed 13 lives and made 36,000 people homeless in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The major Siberian river, the Lena, and the Aldan have both flooded over their banks in recent weeks as a result of the springtime snow melt. Authorities had to use helicopters to evacuate 900 people from four riverside villages to the east of Yakutsk.  In total 42,600 people had to be evacuated. State of emergency has been declared in the region. Around 350,000 people live in the flood-hit area. Local authorities have no resources to help those who have lost their possessions. According to the Emergency Ministry, the thickness of ice floes reached 17 meters in the upper reaches of the Lena and caused it to overflow its banks.  The  river  averages  14  metres  in depth. Russian SU-24 military-planes have been deployed to drop bombs on chunks of ice blocking the Lena and other rivers in the vast Yakutia region. Request for International Assistance Due to the catastrophic impact of this large-scale natural disaster, the Government  of the Russian Federation decided to seek international humanitarian assistance and on 16 June 1998 requested OCHA to launch an international appeal.  The request for assistance is attached, along with the list of relief and rehabilitation needs.

170,37809,[4593],Food and Nutrition,Emergency Update: Oxfam Sudan Appeal,"Oxfam is continuing to appeal to the public for funds for Sudan. The initial appeal, co-ordinated with other agencies in the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), has raised over £6 million. This generous response from the public means fast, effective help for the people of Sudan. Now it's time to look further than the immediate need for humanitarian aid towards a long term solution.  Oxfam is calling for international pressure for a negotiated peace settlement. The only hope for a long term solution is an end to the war between government forces in the north and rebel forces in the south. The aid agencies cannot bring this about. What's needed is political action from the major international powers, including the United Kingdom.  So Oxfam is making its voice heard, taking the opportunity to continue the debate in the media, and using press advertisements to call for an end to the war. This message is combined with an appeal for more funds - people are dying and more will die without direct help.  Oxfam has a large programme in Sudan - providing clean water, improving sanitation, running supplementary feeding centres, distributing seeds, giving health support and health education. With other agencies Oxfam is planning to scale up its efforts to help more people. It is also hoping to offer more support to Operation Lifeline Sudan and the World Food Programme (WFP) food distribution, in financial terms and also by sharing technical expertise.  The United Nations now estimates that as many as 1.2 million people are in immediate need of assistance in southern Sudan. The effort to distribute food to the worst affected areas of the south hasn't been enough to prevent a large growth in the number of people needing food and other assistance. There are now five Hercules aeroplanes flying food and supplies in, but the WFP has raised its estimate of the amount of food that needs to be delivered each month. Previously WFP struggled to deliver the target 6,500 tons - now it's aiming for 9,600 tons each month. It is calling for more funding to support this operation, warning that there's a serious risk that its food stocks will start to run out in July.  Fighting between government and rebel forces continues, causing displacement of people from their homes and further exacerbating the problem of food shortage. In northern Bahr el Ghazal the threat to security caused by the conflict is disrupting aid operations: Oxfam engineers setting up water supplies are frequently forced to evacuate the area due to fears about fighting. In the state of South Kordofan two WFP field officers and a Sudanese Red Crescent Society staff member were killed in an attack on a convoy on 9 June.

HEALTH REQUIREMENTS: Appealing Agency: World Health Organization (WHO) Activity: Provision of basic drugs and medical supplies for health institutions in the flood affected regions of Yakutia, Russian Federation; training of local health professionals in modern case management of acute respiratory infections and proper use of drugs. Target Population: Displaced persons and host communities, populations in flood affected regions. Implementing Agencies: WHO, WHO Collaborating Centre for Emergency and Disaster Medicine Management ""Zaschita"", Ministry of Health. Time Frame: July 1998 - January 1999. Objectives: To strengthen the capability of health care institutions in providing medical services for flood affected populations and to ensure effective disease control and cost-effectiveness of treatment of the most common diseases. Funds Requested: US$1,018,500 Summary: As a result of the severe flooding of the River Lena that hit the Russian Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) in Eastern Siberia in mid-May 1998, almost half of the territorial regions with a population exceeding 140,000, which includes 45,000 children, were flooded. The disaster drove 51,000 people out of their homes, destroyed almost 500 houses out of 4,450 flooded and 3,110 sub-flooded, left 15 people dead, killed thousands of heads of live-stock and damaged nearly 40,000 hectares of agricultural land in a region that is already severely affected by economic crisis. Thousands of people in the flooded zone remain homeless, having lost their property and means of subsistence. According to the situation report of 3 July 1998, provided by staff of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Emergency and Disaster Medicine Management, ""Zaschita"", Russian Federation, who are currently working in Yakutia, medical institutions suffered severe losses. 19 hospitals with a 770 bed capacity, 18 out-patient clinics and obstetrical centres, 3 drugstores and 92 drugstore stations have been flooded. In the medical institutions of Lensky, Namsky and Ust-Maisky localities, medical equipment has broken down as a result of the flooding and is not able to be repaired. Considerable financial means (more than US$3.5 million) is needed to restore and repair health facilities and infrastructure and replenish the stock of lost medications in 14 out of 17 flooded localities. Unfavourable weather conditions in the territory of Sakha Republic (Yakutia), as well as severe social conditions has led to a rise in morbidity of the people who suffered in the flood. The situation is also becoming aggravated due to the absence of safe drinking water, warm clothes and adequate nutrition. In the damaged localities the morbidity of respiratory infections (pneumonia, bronchitis, and acute respiratory diseases) have increased more than twofold; gastrointestinal infections have increased by 40%; hepatitis ""A"" has increased by 30%; there has been a tendency to a rise in depressive conditions and also in cardiovascular diseases, etc. With the prospect of early cold weather arriving in the Republic (August) a considerable rise in morbidity is being forecast. The current economic climate has been severely aggravated by this natural disaster and has led to an inability to sustain basic health services for the Yakutia population. The Government of the Russian Federation, Russian Federation Ministry of Health have undertaken certain measures to stabilize the situation in the Republic, to organize relief work and render medical care to the population. ""Zaschita"" Centre has delivered humanitarian aid to the flood zones including medications, medical equipment and other medical supplies to the value of approximately 400,000 roubles. However, taking into account the scale of the damaged inflicted on the Republic's medical institutions, deterioration of sanitation and the epidemiological situation, weather conditions and the tendency to a rise in population morbidity, the needs of Republican health care institutions are enormous. There is an acute shortage of basic drugs and medical supplies. According to a request from the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, and as a result of a needs assessment conducted by the ""Zaschita"" Centre, the most necessary needs are:-  antibiotics sulphonamide preparations cardiovascular drugs vitamins local and general anaesthetics hypotensive and psychotropic preparations blood substitutes immunobiological preparations disposable syringes and blood transfusion systems x-ray equipment laboratory equipment and reagents autoclaves physical therapy devices surgical instrument sets dressing and suture materialsThe most appropriate and effective way to respond to the situation is the provision of WHO medical kits which are designed to meet the needs of populations whose medical facilities have been severely affected or disrupted by natural or other disasters. These kits contain drugs, medical supplies and essential equipment. WHO intends to provide and distribute relevant kits which would cover the basic health needs of the population of the flood affected area. In order to improve the efficiency of drug usage and ensure proper diagnosis and case management of acute respiratory infections in line with WHO protocols, WHO, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health intends to provide training to health professionals especially in rural areas. For the most part, the implementation of the activities described above would be carried out by WHO through the WHO Collaborating Centre ""Zaschita"". Some of the operational costs are covered by the Centre from other sources. Funds are required to compliment the resources of the implementing agency and for the transportation of relief items within the country and at local level.

172,38037,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,Rwanda: Food Security,"Appeal no: 12/98 (revised) THIS APPEAL SEEKS CHF 810,000 IN CASH, KIND AND SERVICES TO ASSIST 35,000 BENEFICIARIES FOR 5 MONTHS Summary For the last several years the Prefecture of Gikongoro, situated in the South West of Rwanda has suffered chronic food shortages. The land is inherently difficult to farm, with high acidity levels in the soil and low use of fertiliser or other agricultural aids. The 400,000 people in the region are extremely poor and unable to upgrade their farming methods to cope with the challenges posed. The Government of Rwanda launched an appeal in October of 1997 for food support, identifying Gikongoro as one of the most needy regions. In February a Federation/Rwandan Red Cross Society assessment mission found visible evidence of serious malnutrition among children and adults. To counter this, the Federation launched an Appeal at the end of March 1998, which to date has attracted insufficient donor support, necessitating a revision to allow the agricultural element of the programme to proceed on time. If seeds are not in the ground by September, the opportunity to assist 35,000 of Rwanda's most vulnerable with a sustainable aid programme will have been lost. The beneficiaries are in the rural communes of Mudasowa, Musebya, Muko and Musange, and will receive 429 MT of seeds, 600,000 cuttings, appropriate farm implements, fertilisers and soil dressing products, and 284 MT of foodstuffs. The primary objective of the operation is to contribute to greater food security in the affected communes. Seed distribution will be the first step towards reconstituting the available seed stock for farmers in the area. Thus, although the operation features a once-off distribution, its effects will have a positive impact in future planting seasons. The Disaster At the end of 1996 Gikongoro Prefecture was struck by severe drought conditions which continued in 1997 until rains arrived in October. Unfortunately the rains came on too strongly and the resultant flooding washed away recent plantings of beans and sweet potatoes, forcing families to eat their seed stocks to survive. Numerous factors conspired to reduce food production across the country and drive the prices of staple foods even higher. Production is still not back to 1990 levels, while insecurity in the Northwest, Rwanda's most fertile region, has greatly reduced the amount of land under cultivation. People are fleeing the area and hectares of farming land beside roads have been cleared to deny cover to paramilitary groups. Food prices rose dramatically in 1997, doubling for beans and increasing ten fold for sweet potatoes. The lack of food has devastated the 13 communes of the prefecture and a FAO/WFP report conducted in February estimates 70% of the households in Gikongoro are in need of aid. People weakened by hunger are proving more vulnerable to malaria and as food crops dwindle, people have less cash to buy medicine to fight the disease, allowing it to make a virulent resurgence. The Response so far Government Action The Government of Rwanda has announced a food deficit of 82,000 MT, confirmed by WFP in a press statement in mid-March. The Prefect of Gikongoro appealed to the Rwandan Red Cross Society (RRCS) and the Federation to assist in his prefecture. Red Cross/Red Crescent Action RRCS/Federation have carried out two assessment missions to the region. In February the mission included an Agronomist, the Federation Senior Desk Officer and Senior Relief Officer. In the intervening months the Delegation and the RRCS re-evaluated the original Appeal, made several field visits to talk with community leaders, and have revised the original Appeal into a more focused and feasible effort. Negotiations are ongoing with WFP to provide foodstuffs on a food for work basis for the seed protection element of the project. Other Agencies' Action In 1997 WFP, in co-operation with the government, distributed six monthly rations to over 500,000 people. In the first half of 1998 they hope to distribute to over 600,000 but may be unable to reach that target due to supply and logistics constraints. Over the next month WFP will carry out a food distribution of 500 MT in the Gikongoro Prefecture, through the offices of the local bourgemeisters. World Vision has been implementing agricultural projects in the Gikongoro Prefecture for several years, though not in the communes targeted by this Appeal. Co-ordination The project will be co-ordinated by the Ministry of Agriculture, RRCS and the Federation Delegation in consultation with the WFP office in Kigali. The Delegation and the RRCS are consulting with World Vision to avoid duplication of effort. World Vision will also provide advice on the types of seeds needed and potential sources of purchase. An FAO Agronomist has been hired as an advisor to the Delegation /RRCS and is providing agricultural expertise. The Intended Operation Assessment of Needs The findings of the RRCS/Federation assessment are supported by the FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Report issued on February 16. Insufficient food production, late rains followed by flooding and high malnutrition rates all point to the need for quick intervention. In June, the Head of the RRCS Relief Department returned to the target communes to reassess the needs in anticipation of the current revision. Her recommendations include focusing on only the most needy in the communes i.e. 30 % of the affected families. Her discussions with local farmers led to a change in the type of seeds and cuttings to be provided. In high altitudes potatoes were the most requested items. As September is not the planting season for wheat, these seeds have been eliminated from the appeal. Garden vegetables (tomatoes, cabbage, aubergines, carrots, etc.) have also been added after discussions with the beneficiaries. The addition of potatoes has meant that the amount of fertiliser and pesticide provided will be increased substantially from the amount requested in the original appeal. In consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture and FAO/Rwanda, the following criteria have been established for beneficiary identification:  Farmers registered with Ministry for Agriculture as having a poor harvest in the preceding planting season; Farmers who failed to plant in the preceding season; Recently repatriated farmers attempting to re-establish their farms; Farmers recently regrouped onto new land; Households managed solely by women with no other source of income.People unable to manage their land will be assisted by neighbours willing to work the land in return for payment from the resulting crop. Immediate Needs Initial response to the Appeal has been strong but insufficient. The immediate need is for cash to purchase the required seeds, fertiliser and farm implements. Anticipated Later Needs The food for seed protection must arrive at the same time as the planned distribution of seeds in order to assure that 100 % are planted. The seed distribution will take place as close as possible to the start of the planting season (early September). Red Cross Objectives  To contribute to food security for 35,000 people in Gikongoro Prefecture; To rebuild the available seed stock in the communes through seed multiplication; To support, improve and help to stabilise agricultural production in the area; To train RRCS volunteers in the Prefecture in disaster response and agricultural assistance; To reduce ethnic tensions in the country by reducing competition for food resources. In conjunction with Rwandan Red Cross Community Based First Aid programme to reduce susceptibility to malaria through public education on preventative and curative health measures.National Society/Federation Plan of Action Phase One: July - August 1998 Raise sufficient funds for the start of the operation. Purchase seeds, fertiliser, pesticide and farm implements. Train RRCS leaders and volunteers from the Gikongoro Prefecture Phase Two: September 1998 Distribute seeds and farm implements and food as seed protection. Agronomist from FAO will advise farmers' groups on planting and generating seed stock for the next planting season. Monitoring will be carried out under the supervision of the Secretary General of the RRCS. Daily reports will be issued to the Federation Delegation. Phase Three: October-December 1998 Crop progress will be monitored. The agronomist will advise farmers' organisations on crop maintenance. A final report will be issued on the impact of the programme with recommendations for action in following seasons. Capacity of the National Society RRCS was commended for its assistance to refugees returning from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania at the end of 1996. Its Community Based First Aid (CBFA) programme has 360 volunteers in place, qualified to carry out health education. In the past few months it has assumed camp management responsibilities in Mudende and Byumbu, and it has sufficient numbers of volunteers at headquarters and prefecture level to assist with this programme. Its logistics department, with the support of the Federation Delegation, will handle logistical needs and a consultant agricultural engineer working with FAO will provide technical support. Capacity will be augmented by training in Federation distribution and reporting procedures. Present Capacity of the Federation in Rwanda The Federation Delegation numbers 15 delegates, and agricultural expertise will be brought in on a short term basis as mentioned. The Head of Delegation and the Finance Delegate will assist in the areas of management reporting and financial administration. The Federation Logistics delegate will co-ordinate the logistics effort. Since the launch of the original appeal, the Delegation has been strengthened by the addition of a Disaster Prevention and Preparation Delegate who is experienced in relief distributions and will provide training and support for the operation. The CBFA Delegate is ready to initiate health education in the prefecture. The Regional Relief Co-ordinator from Nairobi will be called upon for technical support and advice. The Regional Information Delegate will provide a flow of information and media coverage. The Regional Logistics Centre in Nairobi will provide extra logistics support. Evaluation RRCS and the Federation Delegation will monitor the distributions. Evaluations will take place and reports will be issued at the end of each phase of the operation, in September and December. Conclusion The security situation in the four communes is a particular concern of the Delegation. Though calm for the most part, they are close to the Nyungwe Forest which is a very insecure area making it unlikely that the distributions can be carried out in the presence of Federation Delegates. At best, only limited monitoring by Delegates will be possible, giving the RRCS leadership and volunteers responsibility for reporting on their activities in an accurate, timely and transparent manner. The Secretary General and his Deputy will be charged with ensuring that distributions are carried out according Federation procedures and donor requirements. The Delegation will assist by examining all distribution reports on a daily basis and providing support and advice as the programme is implemented. An FAO Agronomist will be contracted not only to supply advice to the operation but also to provide an independent evaluation of the intervention and its impact. For the appeal to achieve its goals, an immediate response in cash or kind is required. Currently 18 % of the needs have been covered through contributions and pledges. Much of the remaining amount must be pledged before the end of July if the operation is to proceed as planned.

George Weber Secretary General Margareta Wahlström Under Secretary General, Disaster Response & Operations Coordination","Rwanda: Food Security Appeal no: 12/98 (revised) THIS APPEAL SEEKS CHF 810,000 IN CASH, KIND AND SERVICES TO ASSIST 35,000 BENEFICIARIES FOR 5 MONTHS Summary For the last several years the Prefecture of Gikongoro, situated in the South West of Rwanda has suffered chronic food shortages. The land is inherently difficult to farm, with high acidity levels in the soil and low use of fertiliser or other agricultural aids. The 400,000 people in the region are extremely poor and unable to upgrade their farming methods to cope with the challenges posed. The Government of Rwanda launched an appeal in October of 1997 for food support, identifying Gikongoro as one of the most needy regions. In February a Federation/Rwandan Red Cross Society assessment mission found visible evidence of serious malnutrition among children and adults. To counter this, the Federation launched an Appeal at the end of March 1998, which to date has attracted insufficient donor support, necessitating a revision to allow the agricultural element of the programme to proceed on time. If seeds are not in the ground by September, the opportunity to assist 35,000 of Rwanda's most vulnerable with a sustainable aid programme will have been lost. The beneficiaries are in the rural communes of Mudasowa, Musebya, Muko and Musange, and will receive 429 MT of seeds, 600,000 cuttings, appropriate farm implements, fertilisers and soil dressing products, and 284 MT of foodstuffs. The primary objective of the operation is to contribute to greater food security in the affected communes. Seed distribution will be the first step towards reconstituting the available seed stock for farmers in the area. Thus, although the operation features a once-off distribution, its effects will have a positive impact in future planting seasons. The Disaster At the end of 1996 Gikongoro Prefecture was struck by severe drought conditions which continued in 1997 until rains arrived in October. Unfortunately the rains came on too strongly and the resultant flooding washed away recent plantings of beans and sweet potatoes, forcing families to eat their seed stocks to survive. Numerous factors conspired to reduce food production across the country and drive the prices of staple foods even higher. Production is still not back to 1990 levels, while insecurity in the Northwest, Rwanda's most fertile region, has greatly reduced the amount of land under cultivation. People are fleeing the area and hectares of farming land beside roads have been cleared to deny cover to paramilitary groups. Food prices rose dramatically in 1997, doubling for beans and increasing ten fold for sweet potatoes. The lack of food has devastated the 13 communes of the prefecture and a FAO/WFP report conducted in February estimates 70% of the households in Gikongoro are in need of aid. People weakened by hunger are proving more vulnerable to malaria and as food crops dwindle, people have less cash to buy medicine to fight the disease, allowing it to make a virulent resurgence. The Response so far Government Action The Government of Rwanda has announced a food deficit of 82,000 MT, confirmed by WFP in a press statement in mid-March. The Prefect of Gikongoro appealed to the Rwandan Red Cross Society (RRCS) and the Federation to assist in his prefecture. Red Cross/Red Crescent Action RRCS/Federation have carried out two assessment missions to the region. In February the mission included an Agronomist, the Federation Senior Desk Officer and Senior Relief Officer. In the intervening months the Delegation and the RRCS re-evaluated the original Appeal, made several field visits to talk with community leaders, and have revised the original Appeal into a more focused and feasible effort. Negotiations are ongoing with WFP to provide foodstuffs on a food for work basis for the seed protection element of the project. Other Agencies' Action In 1997 WFP, in co-operation with the government, distributed six monthly rations to over 500,000 people. In the first half of 1998 they hope to distribute to over 600,000 but may be unable to reach that target due to supply and logistics constraints. Over the next month WFP will carry out a food distribution of 500 MT in the Gikongoro Prefecture, through the offices of the local bourgemeisters. World Vision has been implementing agricultural projects in the Gikongoro Prefecture for several years, though not in the communes targeted by this Appeal. Co-ordination The project will be co-ordinated by the Ministry of Agriculture, RRCS and the Federation Delegation in consultation with the WFP office in Kigali. The Delegation and the RRCS are consulting with World Vision to avoid duplication of effort. World Vision will also provide advice on the types of seeds needed and potential sources of purchase. An FAO Agronomist has been hired as an advisor to the Delegation /RRCS and is providing agricultural expertise. The Intended Operation Assessment of Needs The findings of the RRCS/Federation assessment are supported by the FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Report issued on February 16. Insufficient food production, late rains followed by flooding and high malnutrition rates all point to the need for quick intervention. In June, the Head of the RRCS Relief Department returned to the target communes to reassess the needs in anticipation of the current revision. Her recommendations include focusing on only the most needy in the communes i.e. 30 % of the affected families. Her discussions with local farmers led to a change in the type of seeds and cuttings to be provided. In high altitudes potatoes were the most requested items. As September is not the planting season for wheat, these seeds have been eliminated from the appeal. Garden vegetables (tomatoes, cabbage, aubergines, carrots, etc.) have also been added after discussions with the beneficiaries. The addition of potatoes has meant that the amount of fertiliser and pesticide provided will be increased substantially from the amount requested in the original appeal. In consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture and FAO/Rwanda, the following criteria have been established for beneficiary identification:  Farmers registered with Ministry for Agriculture as having a poor harvest in the preceding planting season; Farmers who failed to plant in the preceding season; Recently repatriated farmers attempting to re-establish their farms; Farmers recently regrouped onto new land; Households managed solely by women with no other source of income.People unable to manage their land will be assisted by neighbours willing to work the land in return for payment from the resulting crop. Immediate Needs Initial response to the Appeal has been strong but insufficient. The immediate need is for cash to purchase the required seeds, fertiliser and farm implements. Anticipated Later Needs The food for seed protection must arrive at the same time as the planned distribution of seeds in order to assure that 100 % are planted. The seed distribution will take place as close as possible to the start of the planting season (early September). Red Cross Objectives  To contribute to food security for 35,000 people in Gikongoro Prefecture; To rebuild the available seed stock in the communes through seed multiplication; To support, improve and help to stabilise agricultural production in the area; To train RRCS volunteers in the Prefecture in disaster response and agricultural assistance; To reduce ethnic tensions in the country by reducing competition for food resources. In conjunction with Rwandan Red Cross Community Based First Aid programme to reduce susceptibility to malaria through public education on preventative and curative health measures.National Society/Federation Plan of Action Phase One: July - August 1998 Raise sufficient funds for the start of the operation. Purchase seeds, fertiliser, pesticide and farm implements. Train RRCS leaders and volunteers from the Gikongoro Prefecture Phase Two: September 1998 Distribute seeds and farm implements and food as seed protection. Agronomist from FAO will advise farmers' groups on planting and generating seed stock for the next planting season. Monitoring will be carried out under the supervision of the Secretary General of the RRCS. Daily reports will be issued to the Federation Delegation. Phase Three: October-December 1998 Crop progress will be monitored. The agronomist will advise farmers' organisations on crop maintenance. A final report will be issued on the impact of the programme with recommendations for action in following seasons. Capacity of the National Society RRCS was commended for its assistance to refugees returning from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania at the end of 1996.

175,38781,[4589],Contributions,Canada helps bring relief to Sudan's victims of war and drought,"In the fall of 1984, stark images of human suffering in Ethiopia challenged the consciences of Canadians across the country. From Inuit communities to primary school classrooms to national humanitarian agencies, Canadians met this challenge and poured millions into relief and rehabilitation for the affected communities. When Canadian journalist Brian Stewart returned to Ethiopia ten years after his historic report of 1984, we saw how Ethiopia had recovered, we saw the triumph of the human spirit and the lasting solidarity of the Canada-Ethiopia partnership. In many ways, the Ethiopian famine was a defining moment for Canadians. It reminded us of how fortunate we are and it showed us once again that we are in a unique position to make a difference in this world, to help people build peace and a better way of life for themselves. Over the last few years, we have been witnessing the unfolding of another tragedy next door in Sudan. And now, more and more news reports are carrying back stories of the deepening crisis: the fifteen-year-old civil war, coupled with human rights abuses, drought and crop failures, and the famine that has been threatening more than 700,000 people living in the southern province of Bahr-el-Ghazal. The international aid community is already mobilized through Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), a coordinated effort of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations to organize and deliver humanitarian assistance in Sudan. OLS is airlifting food and supplies into the remote and inaccessible communities in the South that are most at risk. Among the major supporters of the OLS are the European Community, the US, the Netherlands, Norway, the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Australia and Canada. It is an enormous challenge. The continuing civil conflict, combined with drought and crop failures, requires sustained action by Canada and other members of the international community. Since January of this year, CIDA has contributed over $9 million of emergency assistance targeted at the most vulnerable in Sudan. UNICEF, an organization devoted to children, has been a key recipient agency. A large amount of assistance has gone to its food security programs, which encourage family self-sufficiency by providing tools, seeds, fishing equipment and livestock vaccines to affected communities. Canadian support also went to emergency response readiness so that UNICEF could respond quickly to the crisis in Bahr-el-Ghazal. And Canada provided funds for the air transportation of relief supplies from the UN and non-governmental organizations. The International Committee of the Red Cross received support for its program in Sudan focusing on emergency relief and health activities for all victims of the conflict. To meet the critical food situation, especially in Bahr-el-Ghazal province, I have approved an additional $500,000 to support nutritional feeding for children and other needy people by World Vision Canada. Five million dollars has been directed to the World Food Program for food supplies and transportation, benefiting women and children.  But that only takes care of the short term. We need more than money to continue the lifeline. We also need peace. We can't get aid to those who desperately need it if shipments are diverted, if planes cannot land, or if military actions cut off whole regions from outside help. The cease-fire is a step in the right direction, but the only real answer is an end to the conflict. Canada has been active on the diplomatic front, applying pressure for improved human rights and supporting and promoting a negotiated political settlement to the hostilities. We have been a vocal critic of human rights abuses by all parties to the conflict, regularly co-sponsoring resolutions at the UN General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights condemning abuses in the civil war. Our bilateral aid program was suspended in1992 due to prolonged and widespread human rights abuses. Since 1994, Canada has been working with other donor countries to support regional African efforts towards peace. We provided financial support for expert resource people from the Inter-Africa Group to help in strategy sessions and negotiations associated with the peace process. Last June, we were the first country to provide institutional support - $2.5 million - to the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). IGAD is a group of 7 countries in the Horn of Africa whose mandate is conflict prevention, economic cooperation and food security. Through its conflict resolution unit, IGAD has been working to bring the parties to the table to discuss the core issues in the conflict - self-determination and secularism. There is a saying that there can be no development without peace. The southern region of Sudan has been devastated by a civil war that has caused one out of every four deaths since 1983, destroyed its economy and undermined health, education and food production. Yet Sudan has enormous potential: before the war, Sudan was known as the ""breadbasket of Africa"", and it holds oil reserves equal to those in Western Canada. Peace will lift an enormous burden from the 25 million people of Sudan, improving the human rights situation and putting the country back on the road to rehabilitation and development. It will also contribute immensely to the stability and development of the entire Horn of Africa region. Canada will continue to put pressure on all parties to achieve a negotiated settlement. Until that time, we will work with our African partners to end the suffering that challenges our sense of justice and calls upon our humanity to respond.

176,39188,[49458],Camp Coordination and Camp Management,China Floods Revised Appeal (21/98),"THIS APPEAL SEEKS CHF 13,604,000 IN CASH AND SERVICES TO ASSIST 2 MILLION BENEFICIARIES Summary It has been raining virtually non-stop in China for the last five months. The rains are causing vast flooding that is now affecting an estimated 223 million people. Because of the magnitude of the disaster and the anticipated worsening of the situation in the northern provinces of China, the Federation has decided to reinforce its support to the Red Cross Society of China by increasing the Emergency Appeal budget from 6.7 million CHF to 13.6 million CHF, as the number of beneficiaries rises to two million, to include the newly affected in norther China's Heilongjiang Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The Background Flooding caused by almost continuous rains since March is now affecting an estimated 223 million people in 29 provinces in central, south east and northern China. The Yangtze River has reached record levels, and in many areas the floods are being described as the worst in living memory. According to the latest official figures, more than 3,000 people have been killed, 4.97 million houses have been destroyed and some 14 million people have been left homeless. In total, 21 million hectares of land have been flooded and 4.78 million hectares of crops have been destroyed. Meteorological forecasts indicate that the flood season will continue well into September. Temperatures are now dropping in the northern provinces, and cold fronts from Siberia could bring snow to the region in a matter of weeks. Latest events Conditions are worsening in central China where the waters have now reached levels unseen since floods in 1954 killed more than 30,000 people, and are continuing to rise. Waterlogged, secondary levees (mud embankments) are collapsing along the flood-swollen Yangtze River, the world's third longest river. Millions of soldiers and civilians are maintaining round-the-clock vigils on the dikes, watching for signs of collapse and plugging leaks. (There are some 6,300 km of dikes along the river). In Hubei Province alone, some 1,697 dike locations have been repaired, according to official reports. Many flooded areas in south east and central China are now in the grip of an oppressive heat wave that has sent temperatures rocketing to 39 degrees Celsius. Heat-stroke and dehydration are on the rise as those who have sought safety on the dikes bake under the sun. The high temperatures alternate with torrential rains. In Hunan, 31.29 million people are now affected by the floods with 1.93 million evacuated, and 240,000 left homeless. In Jiangxi 46 days of rain caused flooding that has left 1.59 million people homeless. In the north and north east, the situation continues to deteriorate. Some 2.16 million people in Heilongjiang Province are homeless, with 900,000 of them living in the open. Some 52 counties in the province, covering 33,000 sq. km and including 622 villages, have been flooded to date. Previous dike breaches along the Nenjiang rivers have forced the relocation of more than 100,000 residents. In Inner Mongolia, floods have so far affected 5.67 million people, destroying 250,000 homes and leaving some 375,000 people homeless. At least 117 people have died, and 861,300 people have been evacuated. Temperatures are now dropping to 10 degrees Celsius at night. Cases of typhoid and cholera have been reported and environmental pollution in the flooded areas could increase the possibility of epidemics in the coming months, according to the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The Response so far Red Cross relief action The Red Cross Society of China (RCSC) has been carrying out relief work throughout China since the onset of the floods. So far, it has assisted some 1.5 million people, drawing on financial support from the Federation and from local fundraising. There are some 10,000 Red Cross / Public Health teams working in the flood areas and water purification tablets are being distributed. Emergency assistance continues in the worst affected provinces. In Jiangxi province, some 3,700 Red Cross and Public Health medical and sanitation teams have been dispatched to provide assistance and free treatment to more than one million affected people. By 22 August, RCSC in Jiangxi province had received domestic and international relief materials including medicines, food, clothing and drinking water worth RMB 10 million (CHF 1.8 million). Some RMB 4 million (CHF 727,000) worth of these donations have been distributed so far. In Hunan, some 210 Red Cross/ Public Health medical teams distributed more than RMB 1.48 million (CHF 269,000) worth of medicines prior to 22 July. From 23 July onwards, more than 1,500 medical teams consisting of 15,000 staff, were dispatched and the RCSC Hunan branch has raised more than RMB 2 million (CHF 364,000) worth of medicine, food, clothing, disinfectants and other materials. Fund-raising The Red Cross Society of China continues to fund-raise at both headquarters and branch level. Donations received remain primarily in-kind goods. Low cash contributions continue to make it difficult to transport in-kind donations. Camp management The Red Cross is helping the displaced in temporary encampments on the dikes. During a recent assessment trip the Federation team observed Red Cross rice and medicine distributions on dikes in northern regions of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. In many areas, affected villages maintain their governance structure once re-established on the dikes. In some cases, this structure has taken on a support role to help relief teams maintain sanitation and distribute relief supplies to the most vulnerable. Government Action Both the central and provincial levels of government are actively involved in the distribution of relief materials throughout the flood affected areas and have mobilised significant resources to fight the floods. The Department of Health continues to take a lead role in staffing and supporting thousands of medical teams which provide direct service to flood victims. External relations The Federation Delegation in China continues to work with the media: it completed 21 interviews over the past week, with both international and Chinese national media, on the human aspects of this disaster, the work of the Red Cross Society of China, the needs of those affected, and the Federation's initial appeal for CHF 6.7 million. So far, since the launch of the appeal, the delegation and the Federation Secretariat has given some 100 interviews, providing high visibility to Red Cross humanitarian efforts. The RCSC is increasingly seen as a leading humanitarian agency in China, mainly due to its extended grass-roots capacity in all provinces. The National Society has high visibility and receives tremendous support from local communities and enterprises. Last week, discussions commenced with the World Health Organisation (WHO) on health issues and with the World Food Program (WFP). A co-ordination meeting was held with Medecins du Monde. Discussions with Handicap International, an NGO currently working with disabled people in Guangxi province, on how they can best complement Red Cross flood assistance also began. Recently representatives from MSF met with the Federation to discuss long-term health issues and determine areas of future need. Information sharing with Beijing-based embassies continues on a weekly basis. The Intended Operation Assessment of Needs In mid-July, a Federation assessment mission to flood-affected areas in central China provided first hand information that became the basis of the Federation's initial appeal launched 20 July. Since the appeal launch, ongoing needs assessments by both the Federation and the RCSC throughout central, south east and northern China have closely monitored the rapidly changing disaster situation and the ever increasing needs of flood victims. These assessments all point to a steadily worsening situation and the need to adjust the appeal to better meet the needs of the most vulnerable among those affected. Planning RCSC provincial response teams are now planning for the upcoming relief needs of affected people with an emphasis on items required to face the pending change of seasons and associated drop in temperatures. With winter temperatures approaching in north and north-eastern China, Red Cross Branches in these areas are already facing an increased demand for warm quilts and winter clothing. The revised Appeal will target the immediate procurement and distribution of blankets, quilts and heavy coats, food, and medical and sanitation supplies, including water purification tablets. Under the expanded Appeal, the RCSC plans to continue distributions of food rations and medical supplies, concentrating on the most vulnerable communities. Food and non-food distribution planning takes account of the following three points:  Severity of the disaster (for example, the Dongting Lake area was severely affected by historic flooding levels and has an enormous affected population.)  Endemic health issues within a locality that represent additional risk factors (for example, areas that have endemic diseases such as shistosomiasis).  Capacity: if an affected population has food security (access to a harvest or to unaffected agricultural land) they receive less assistance than those areas with low food security.The RCSC's primary source of information for the above three points is its local, grass-roots branches. This information is supplemented by population statistics and data on the numbers of affected people -- both figures received from government sources . Red Cross Objectives - To ensure the rapid mobilisation of funds and goods to provide immediate assistance; - To provide basic food (rice/wheat) to more than 1 million people for 20 days with a ration equivalent to 1,600 Kcal per day; - To supply medical and sanitation teams with basic medical and sanitation supplies to assist 85,000 beneficiaries; - To provide 1.5 million people with safe water for a period of 60 days by supplying 90 million water purification tablets (representing 10 litres of water per person per day); - To provide winter quilts and blankets to 300,000 people; - To provide heavy overcoats to 50,000 people. Procurement All relief items are being procured in China. Donors are asked to note that it is prohibited to import used clothing into China. Capacity of the RCSC, and the Federation The RCSC has an extensive nation-wide network of 153,000 grassroots volunteer groups, 2,562 county and district branches, 347 prefecture and city branches and 31 provincial branches. During the last 15 years the number of members has increased from 1.5 million to almost 23 million, making the RCSC the largest National Society in the world. The RCSC has extensive experience in relief operations. Operational procedures and effective management structures are well in place. The Red Cross has an excellent working relationship with local authorities and a decentralised approach. It has a proven record in the mobilisation of resources. The Federation has had a permanent presence in China since early this year. The operation will continue to be supported by the Federation Delegation, which is composed of four delegates -- one representative, one information/reporting delegate and two field delegates with monitoring and reporting functions -- and in addition receives technical support in the areas of finance and information from the Federation's Southeast and East Asia Regional Delegation. Conclusion The deteriorating situation and the increasing numbers of people affected make it essential to expand the scope of the present operation and despatch relief to beneficiaries as rapidly as possible. To achieve this, continuing support is urgently required. The most pressing need is for cash. National Societies that have made pledges are urged to transfer fu nds as soon as possible, to allow large scale procurement of relief items to move ahead.

177,39273,[4589],Contributions,War Displaced In Tigray and Afar Regions: UN Response Summary,"Prepared by the UN Country Team in Ethiopia TABLE OF CONTENTS Executive Summary Background Findings of the UN Inter-Agency Missions Response to DPPC Appeal  Food and Nutrition Health Water and Sanitation Shelter and Household Items Other Assistance  Annex I. Summary Table of Un Country Team Assistance EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Following the appeal for assistance to people displaced by the current Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict issued by the Ethiopian Government's Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission (DPPC), the United Nations (UN) in Ethiopia sent two UN inter-agency assessment teams to the two affected areas. The missions conducted a rapid assessment of the conditions and needs of the displaced people (DP) in terms of food, shelter, health and access to water and sanitation. The findings of the missions were compiled in a report, ""Humanitarian Needs of War-Displaced People in Northern and North-eastern Ethiopia.""1 Taking into consideration the DPPC's appeal and based on the findings of the UN inter-agency missions, the UN Country Team started planning, in collaboration with DPPC, the areas and size of their assistance to the war-displaced. Existing emergency resources have been committed and supplies are already being forwarded to the regions. Budgets for additional programmes have been calculated and individual agency appeals to the international donors have been prepared. This Summary outlines the broad areas of the UN Country Team’s intervention and highlights the efforts made by the Team to harmonise programmes to ensure the maximum impact. UN assistance incorporates relief supplies made immediately available, emergency materials, funds and re-programmed resources allocated to programmes for the displaced, and programmes for which additional, new funding is required. More detailed information on specific agency interventions can be obtained from the concerned agency’s Addis Ababa office or from their headquarters. UN interventions from existing resources, reimbursable resources and resources appealed for in this document cover the following areas: (Also please see Graphs on page 2 and Table on page 12):    FINANCIAL SUMMARY    Budget Item  US$    Food and nutrition (5,000 MTs of grain re-programmed)  1,600,000    Health  914,000    Water and Sanitation  400,000    Shelter and household items  484,000    Education and special protection needs  395,000    Logistical support  85,000    Assessment, monitoring and evaluation  90,000    Other  175,000    TOTAL  4,143,000    Many UN Agencies have expressed interest in obtaining information regarding other donor pledges and the utilisation of local contributions. This report summarises current plans of the UN Country Team for an initial response to the DPPC appeal. Once additional gaps are identified, the UN will be able to determine what further interventions may be necessary. BACKGROUND On 15 June 1998, the Ethiopian Government's Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission (DPPC) issued an appeal for assistance covering about 145,000 DP (in the non-food sector), and a planning figure of 300,000 DP (for food and nutrition assistance). In response to this appeal, the UN sent two UN inter-agency assessment teams to the two affected areas. These two teams, accompanied by DPPC personnel, were composed of United Nations Development Programme - Emergency Unit for Ethiopia (UNDP-EUE), World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and International Organization for Migration (IOM). The teams visited the northern region of Tigray and Afar during the period of 19 - 24 June to conduct a rapid assessment of the condition and needs of the war-affected people in terms of food, health, shelter/household, access to water and sanitation. The findings of the mission were compiled in the document ""Humanitarian Needs of War-Displaced People in Northern and north-eastern Ethiopia."" At the Disaster Management Team (DMT) Meeting of 10 July 1998, it was agreed that the UN Country Team in Ethiopia would approach the appeal process through a joint, Resident-Coordinator-driven-appeal, and prepare a covering document summarising the planned interventions of the UN Agencies in response to the DPPC appeal. More detailed information on individual agency programmes can be obtained from the concerned agencies. Based on the figures of DP needing immediate assistance estimated by DPPC and endorsed by the UN inter-agency missions (i.e. the 168,000 in Tigray region and the 20,000 Afars and non-Afars in Afar region), this Summary gives an indication of the inputs from the UN which can be funded from existing resources and the portions which would be subject to an additional appeal to the donor community by the individual agencies. UN assistance is designed to complement donations from other international partners and local resources and it is not the intention of this appeal to cover all needs. Consequently, donors are urged to review the overall assistance requirements as outlined in the DPPC appeal and to assist in filling the remaining gaps. In the interest of facilitating DPPC's coordination of humanitarian aid to the war-displaced from different sources and harmonising UN assistance, this summary indicates:   identified needs of the displaced based on an assumed six-month initial period of emergency programming;    assistance pledged by UN Agencies in Ethiopia, including existing, re-programmed and re-imbursable resources;   additional funding requested by UN Agencies.   Not included in this Summary is data for contingency needs, if the situation were to deteriorate. A contingency planning exercise, in conjunction with the DPPC, is planned for the near future. Rehabilitation needs, which can only be determined when the displaced are able to return to their homes, have been excluded from this appeal. FINDINGS OF THE UN INTER-AGENCY MISSIONS General The UN Country Team assessment endorsed the main elements of the DPPC appeal. Both missions felt that the registration and screening system set up by the local authorities was comprehensive and, therefore, concluded that numbers and requests for assistance in the DPPC appeal were reasonable. The UN Agencies have agreed to base their budget calculations on an assumed six-month initial period of emergency programming and on a total of 190,000 DP. The UN missions were impressed with the local emergency coordination mechanisms set-up in Tigray and Afar. They pointed out that these coordinating systems had facilitated the distribution of initial relief assistance provided to date. They fully agreed with the governmental strategy to meet the needs of the displaced population by depending upon and bolstering existing structures. There have been significant local contributions to the ""displaced and war-affected"" with about US$ 10 million having been collected as of end of June. At the moment, it is unclear what portion of these funds is actually earmarked for the displaced or how the funds will be used. Nevertheless, the feeling of the UN assessment team was that UN assistance should complement, not replace these very commendable local efforts. Recommendations on Relief Assistance A) Food and nutrition requirementsThe missions’ findings clearly pointed out that food assistance is justified as the displaced have already put a heavy burden on the meagre resources of the hosting communities. Discussions were also held with the local authorities and the DPPC at the federal level on the issue of possible duplication of beneficiaries from the drought relief programme and this new emergency programme for the displaced. The Government will look into the means to resolve this potential problem. The missions recommend that immediate food assistance be provided to the 168,000 DP in Tigray and to 2,013 DP in Afar Region. The food needs of the remaining DP in Afar region needs further assessment. B) Health assistance requirementsThe Government’s policy of relying on existing health structures has resulted in the re-orientation of health services with health centres currently taking increasing responsibility for health services, while the hospitals cater to urgent civilian cases only. So far, the Government has been able to cater to the most essential needs of the displaced, but supplies are running out and, in some cases, budgets have already been exhausted. The mission reports indicate that there is a need to strengthen existing health services through the provision of supplies and, eventually, health personnel at all levels. Regular health programmes are to be sustained, including vaccination and immunisation campaigns. C) Water and sanitation assistance requirementsThe UN assessment reveals that housing of the displaced within existing communities, while commendable, is placing great stress on what was already a situation of meagre water resources. In Afar Region, this situation is aggravated due to the closure of the Assab road, stopping the arrangement of providing water by truck from Assab to the communities in need. To avoid further displacement due to lack of potable water, the mission to Afar recommends to supply the communities with jerry cans, water bladders, water purification material, additional water tankers, fittings to repair old or construct new water resources, as well as to support financing of trucking water in Afar Region. D) Shelter and householdThe UN mission notes that most of the displaced may have lost part or all of their economic assets and are depending either on relief or on the host community. In Tigray, especially since the rainy season has started, additional shelter materials are needed, as many of the host households can not provide adequate rooms or shelter. The mission recommends cooking and feeding utensils, tents, blankets and reinforced plastic sheets to be supplied to the affected areas. RESPONSE TO DPPC APPEAL FOOD AND NUTRITION The DPPC appealed for food and nutrition assistance for 300,000 DP. This is a planning figure that includes people likely to be affected in case of escalation of the present conflict. The UN Country Team prefers to consider the scenario of possible conflict escalation in a separate contingency plan, while maintaining the flexibility to launch an immediate appeal in case of aggravation of the current situation in terms of food and nutrition. It should also be noted that if the displaced in Tigray are not able to return to their communities in the near future, they will miss the main agriculture season and food assistance will have to be provided until around November 1999. Resources Pledged by UN Agencies World Food Programme (WFP)In collaboration with the DPPC, WFP has agreed to the re-allocation of 5,000 MTs of WFP cereal provided under a previous emergency operation to assist in meeting the needs of the displaced population. The total value of the re-allocated commodities, inclusive of all associated transport costs, is US$ 1.6 million. At the time of writing this Appeal, the most urgent food needs are therefore being met through the re-allocation of drought relief resources, as well as various relatively small donations of supplementary food from non-UN sources. Additional Resources Required WFPWFP endorses the UN inter-agency missions’ assessment of food assistance based on an estimate of the currently displaced population and calls upon the international donors to channel an initial six-month-ration through WFP or other partners working in the field. If the situation in Tigray and Afar deteriorates or is prolonged indefinitely, WFP proposes a re-assessment of food assistance needs in affected areas and the possible launching of a new emergency operation (EMOP) that will appeal directly for funding and support to international donors. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)FAO does not normally provide emergency food and shelter assistance. However, FAO has been active in rehabilitation in Ethiopia for many years and when the displaced return home, FAO would consider rehabilitation assistance in the agriculture sector, if funding were available. An assessment of input requirements could be carried out at the earliest next year, since the current year's planting season will be over in August. HEALTH All three UN Agencies working in the health sector, UNICEF, WHO and UNFPA, have proposed an emergency programme under this sector. UNICEF will concentrate on Emergency Health, Safe Delivery and Vaccination, WHO on Emergency Health and UNFPA on Reproductive Health. UNICEF and UNFPA plan to provide delivery kits with complementary contents. UNICEF's kits are destined for the ""Traditional birth attendants"" and will be distributed at the lowest health delivery point level. UNFPA's kits are destined for health and referral centres. A Standard Emergency Health Kit, supplied by WHO and UNICEF, covers the essential drugs for 5,000 persons for six months. The same applies to the Safe Delivery and Reproductive Health Kits at the primary health level, whereas the Kits destined for health centres have an increased percentage of coverage due to its being a re-usable material. (15,000 persons for six months). Resources Pledged by UN Agencies United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)UNICEF will appeal to the international donor community for assistance valued at a total of US$ 1.5 million. In order to meet the most pressing emergency needs, UNICEF has already allocated US$ 500,000 from its Global Emergency Programme Fund. However, this is a revolving Fund and US$ 500,000 from this Appeal for US$ 1.5 million will be used to reimburse the Fund. The Agency’s emergency action plan will be implemented in two phases: the first phase will be funded with the US$ 500,000 available now from the Global Emergency Programme Fund, while the implementation of the second phase of US$ 1 million will depend on the resources generated by this Appeal. In the health sector, UNICEF appeals for a total of US$ 380,000, US$ 190,000 of which has been earmarked from the Global Emergency Fund of US$ 500,000. The funds are destined for vaccines, vitamin A capsules, safe delivery kits and Oral Re-hydration Solution (ORS). The ultimate plan is to cover 100 percent of the target population. The budget for the first phase is calculated to cover approximately 60 percent of the target population with the following breakdown:   Pledged from the Global Emergency Fund  (US$)    Measles and meningitis vaccines  120,000    Vitamin A  5,000    Delivery/TBA kits  55,000    ORS  10,000    Value First Phase  190,000    In consultation with the Government, UNICEF will also re-programme 50 Emergency Health Kits to the affected areas. These 50 Kits will cover the health needs of 250,000 persons for six months. Total Value: US$ 250,000 World Health Organization (WHO)WHO has delivered ten Standard Emergency Health Kits donated by the Italian Government with a total coverage of 50,000 persons for a period of six months. These kits have been handed over to the Ministry of Health for transport to the regions and, after mutual agreement upon use and areas to be covered, will be distributed to the selected health facilities. Included in the total budget is US$ 50,000 to cover transport, distribution and implementation costs. Total Value: US$ 150,000 Additional Resources Required UNICEFFor the second phase, UNICEF plans to allocate an additional amount of US$ 190,000 to reach the balance of the vaccination and Vitamin A campaign target population. WHO and WHO Pan-african Emergency Training Centre and Emergency Health Training Programme for Africa (PTC/EHTP)Depending on the gap between recommended needs and pledged quantities of health supply items, WHO will consider additional assistance in the health sector. After reviewing possible additional needs, and if a request is received from Government for capacity-building and training, WHO, in consultation with the WHO Pan-african Emergency Training Centre, could provide technical expertise in emergency health training. United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)UNFPA does not have funds for emergency programmes and, as the Ethiopian Government's general policy is not to use country programme funds for emergencies, UNFPA is appealing to international donors for US$ 134,000 to provide Emergency Reproductive Health Kits to the affected areas (including transport). These kits would complement the Emergency Health Kits being provided by WHO and UNICEF and would contribute, inter alia, to the reduction of maternal and neo-natal mortality, provide an adequate mix of contraceptives and help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. If funds are made available, UNFPA would provide contraceptive kits (condoms, oral and injectable contraceptives), Delivery Kits for health and referral centres, and kits for complications of abortions and post-rape cases. WATER AND SANITATION Resources Pledged By UN Agencies UNICEFUNICEF is the only UN Agency to propose an emergency programme in the area of water and sanitation. After consultations with DPPC, a budget of US$ 400,000 (US$ 130,000 for the first phase) for water and sanitation has been agreed upon. Under this programme, it is anticipated that the DP will have access to five litres of clean water a day. Assuming that some of the existing wells can be rehabilitated, UNICEF has allocated most of the budget to fittings, pipes and other construction material, including pumps (some of them motorised), for more important repair works. In addition, funds are allocated in phases one and two for the purchase of compact water treatment plants, bladders, as well as latrines. UNICEF will carry out further site assessment prior to deciding on a detailed activity plan. The following breakdown is therefore tentative and might be subject to changes.    Supplies and equipment in pledged from Global Emergency Fund    Budget Items  US$    Equipment and tools  94,000    Logistics, monitoring, evaluation  36,000    Total Value  130,000    Additional Resources Required UNICEFIn support of the second phase of Water and Sanitation intervention, UNICEF is seeking funding to cover the following interventions:    Supplies and Equipment    Budget Items  US$    Equipment and tools  197,000    Logistics, monitoring, evaluation  66,000    Training, community mobilisation  7,000    Total Value  270,000    SHELTER AND HOUSEHOLD ITEMS The UN Country Team has agreed to give priority to items that can not be purchased locally, i.e. plastic sheets rather than blankets. The basic calculation used in calculating plastic sheeting needs is ten square metres per family, i.e. at an estimate of 38,000 displaced families, 380,000 sq. metres or 1,900 rolls. Resources Pledged By UN Agencies UNICEFUS$ 40,000 from US$ 500,000 Global Emergency Fund has been allocated for the purchase of 120 rolls of plastic sheeting which were to be shipped in late July. UNHCRIn the framework of a joint UN effort to assist the civilian victims of the current conflict, UNHCR will make available 3,000 kerosene stoves with a total value, inclusive of all transport costs, of US$ 24,000. Additional Resources Required UNICEF A second phase programme is planned for US$ 70,000 for the supply of eight large tents (70 sq. metres each) and 54 family size tents, as well as 2,000 blankets. UNHCROther relief items in the area of shelter and / or household utensils are still being sought from outside. Failing this, up to US$ 15,000 may be made available, in consultation with DPPC, for local procurement of supplies, provided sufficient quantities are not supplied by other agencies. OCHAThe Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), formerly the Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), maintains a warehouse of emergency supplies in Pisa. On the recommendation of the UN Ethiopia Disaster Management Team and in response to an official appeal from the Government, OCHA can request the donor to allocate items on inventory to meet the emergency needs or, if stocks are not readily available from the Pisa warehouse, OCHA can approach other donors for funds. The initial appeal to OCHA will be for 375 rolls of plastic sheeting, valued at approximately US$ 175,000 including transport, enough for 7,500 families at ten sq. meters per family. UNDP’s Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia (EUE) will implement the programme. UNDPThe Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia (EUE) seeks funds in the amount of US$ 175,000 to purchase an additional 350 to 400 rolls of plastic sheeting either directly, or by reimbursing UNHCR for Plastic Sheeting borrowed from UNHCR. If OCHA is able to provide 350 rolls of plastic sheeting, and additional 350 to 400 rolls can be funded from other sources the total UN supply, including the donation from UNICEF, would cover about 46 percent of the shelter needs, at ten sq. meter per family. As shelter materials are one of the most urgent needs, donors are encouraged to donate additional plastic sheeting through the DPPC, the UN, or any of the other operational agencies. OTHER ASSISTANCE Education UNICEFAlthough education was not part of the DPPC appeal, UNICEF seeks funding for a total of US$ 325,000 to support educational programmes for the displaced. Based on the rate of 22 percent of children in the age group of 7-14 years, and a gross enrolment ratio of 50 percent in Tigray and 10 percent in Afar, UNICEF estimates a school-going population among the displaced to be 19,800 children in Tigray and 440 in Afar. Out of the US$ 500,000 Global Emergency Fund, US$ 125,000 has been ear-marked for the first phase intervention which would reach 70 percent of the displaced school-going children. The funds will be used in the following sectors:  Orientation of educational administrators on the planning, implementation and monitoring of Emergency Education Interventions.   Collection of data/information required for planning and designing emergency education interventions.   Provision of educational materials.   Training of in-service teachers in the planning, design and implementation of emergency interventions for displaced children and in the organisation of counselling services.   Advocacy and social mobilisation campaigns using interpersonal communication channels and radio broadcast.  UNESCOUNESCO is considering a contribution to the war-affected children from its Programme for Emergency Education and Rehabilitation. Areas of assistance are still to be determined. UNFPAThe UNFPA Country Support Team (UNFPA/CST) offers its technical expertise in the field of planning, design and implementation of emergency education interventions to support other agencies’ educational programmes. Special Protection Needs of Displaced Children and Women UNICEFUNICEF's budget for special protection needs foresees an emergency programme valued at a total of US$ 70,000. Key actions of the programme are: a) training of local counsellors to provide counselling services to street children and their parents/guardians; b) training of religious leaders, women's groups and social workers to carry out psycho-social trauma counselling and crisis management; c) sensitising community leaders and local authorities to the basic rights of children and women; The first phase of this programme will use US$ 15,000 from the Global Emergency Fund for assessment, analysis and activity planning. Reintegration and Rehabilitation International Organization for Migration (IOM)Subject to an agreement with the Government, IOM would consider requesting funds for a survey to assess the location and number of Ethiopians returning from Eritrea, as well as to make a breakdown in categories (traders, farmers, skilled/unskilled labour, etc.). This categorisation is an essential basis for any rehabilitation and reintegration programme. Logistic Support to UN Agencies UNDPUNDP has made available US$ 40.000 to cover international and local transport costs for supplies donated by other agencies for which there are no transport funds. UNICEFUNICEF is seeking funding for transportation of supplies in the amount of US$ 45,000. Coordination Support to UN Agencies UNDP Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia (EUE)UNDP has allocated funds to engage an international or local temporary Information Officer with the EUE for three months. (Total amount: US$ 12,000) The Information Officer will, in collaboration with other EUE staff, work on the production of reports, briefing materials, appeals and other facets of coordination to assist the Resident Coordinator and the UN Country Team. Capacity-Building, - Contingency Planning in Case of Escalation of the Conflict UNDPUNDP has allocated funds for international and / or local consultants and incidental costs for development of contingency plans. (Total amount: US$ 13,000). IOMIn order to strengthen local capacities, IOM's Emergency Response Unit based in Geneva, if required, can offer training in emergency preparedness, including initiating and maintaining an early warning system, cross border management, legislation and administration. Monitoring, Evaluation and Continuing AssessmentAs the situation along the border remains fluid, continuing assessment and reporting will be critical, as well as regular monitoring and evaluation of the activities implemented through the various components outlined in this Summary. Although most agencies will attempt to use existing staff and the UN Country Team will continue to work as a team, some additional funding will be needed to cover the special monitoring needs of this emergency programme. UNICEFUNICEF's emergency plan includes quarterly programme monitoring and evaluation visits to the project sites, according to guidelines elaborated in collaboration with the Government of Ethiopia. The Agency seeks funding for a global monitoring and evaluation allocation in the amount of US$ 20,000. UNDP-EUEOne of the primary responsibilities of the Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia (EUE) is to support the Resident Coordination system through assisting in the coordination of the UN Country Teams responses to emergencies, facilitating information exchange and monitoring, assessments and evaluations. The EUE does not have a regular budget and must rely on ad hoc contributions from the donor community to cover its yearly operating costs. Included in the 1998 budget but not funded was US$70,000 for the replacement of two field vehicles. Field monitoring is an on-going EUE activity and these vehicles would be used by EUE field officers for the monitoring of UN assistance to the displaced, field visits to the drought-affected areas and for other emergency situations that are likely to arise in the near future. EUE therefore, reiterates its request for funding of US$ 70,000 to replace two field vehicles. This document indicates the UN Country Teams planned interventions in support of the DPPC appeal and how these inputs are harmonised within the UN system and complement the work of the various emergency committees. The intention is to bring to the attention of the international community additional requirements in order that the most urgent needs of the displaced people in Tigray and Afar are met in a timely fashion. Interested donors are urged to contact the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator, on behalf of the Country Team or representatives of the concerned specialised UN Agencies in Ethiopia, for more detailed information on programmes for the displaced. Also, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), has been fully informed of the UN Country Teams plans and can be contacted for additional information. ANNEX I.

Summary Table of Un Country Team Assistance EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Following the appeal for assistance to people displaced by the current Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict issued by the Ethiopian Government's Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission (DPPC), the United Nations (UN) in Ethiopia sent two UN inter-agency assessment teams to the two affected areas. The missions conducted a rapid assessment of the conditions and needs of the displaced people (DP) in terms of food, shelter, health and access to water and sanitation. The findings of the missions were compiled in a report, ""Humanitarian Needs of War-Displaced People in Northern and North-eastern Ethiopia.""1 Taking into consideration the DPPC's appeal and based on the findings of the UN inter-agency missions, the UN Country Team started planning, in collaboration with DPPC, the areas and size of their assistance to the war-displaced. Existing emergency resources have been committed and supplies are already being forwarded to the regions. Budgets for additional programmes have been calculated and individual agency appeals to the international donors have been prepared. This Summary outlines the broad areas of the UN Country Team’s intervention and highlights the efforts made by the Team to harmonise programmes to ensure the maximum impact. UN assistance incorporates relief supplies made immediately available, emergency materials, funds and re-programmed resources allocated to programmes for the displaced, and programmes for which additional, new funding is required. More detailed information on specific agency interventions can be obtained from the concerned agency’s Addis Ababa office or from their headquarters. UN interventions from existing resources, reimbursable resources and resources appealed for in this document cover the following areas: (Also please see Graphs on page 2 and Table on page 12):    FINANCIAL SUMMARY    Budget Item  US$    Food and nutrition (5,000 MTs of grain re-programmed)  1,600,000    Health  914,000    Water and Sanitation  400,000    Shelter and household items  484,000    Education and special protection needs  395,000    Logistical support  85,000    Assessment, monitoring and evaluation  90,000    Other  175,000    TOTAL  4,143,000    Many UN Agencies have expressed interest in obtaining information regarding other donor pledges and the utilisation of local contributions. This report summarises current plans of the UN Country Team for an initial response to the DPPC appeal. Once additional gaps are identified, the UN will be able to determine what further interventions may be necessary. BACKGROUND On 15 June 1998, the Ethiopian Government's Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission (DPPC) issued an appeal for assistance covering about 145,000 DP (in the non-food sector), and a planning figure of 300,000 DP (for food and nutrition assistance). In response to this appeal, the UN sent two UN inter-agency assessment teams to the two affected areas. These two teams, accompanied by DPPC personnel, were composed of United Nations Development Programme - Emergency Unit for Ethiopia (UNDP-EUE), World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and International Organization for Migration (IOM). The teams visited the northern region of Tigray and Afar during the period of 19 - 24 June to conduct a rapid assessment of the condition and needs of the war-affected people in terms of food, health, shelter/household, access to water and sanitation. The findings of the mission were compiled in the document ""Humanitarian Needs of War-Displaced People in Northern and north-eastern Ethiopia."" At the Disaster Management Team (DMT) Meeting of 10 July 1998, it was agreed that the UN Country Team in Ethiopia would approach the appeal process through a joint, Resident-Coordinator-driven-appeal, and prepare a covering document summarising the planned interventions of the UN Agencies in response to the DPPC appeal. More detailed information on individual agency programmes can be obtained from the concerned agencies. Based on the figures of DP needing immediate assistance estimated by DPPC and endorsed by the UN inter-agency missions (i.e. the 168,000 in Tigray region and the 20,000 Afars and non-Afars in Afar region), this Summary gives an indication of the inputs from the UN which can be funded from existing resources and the portions which would be subject to an additional appeal to the donor community by the individual agencies. UN assistance is designed to complement donations from other international partners and local resources and it is not the intention of this appeal to cover all needs. Consequently, donors are urged to review the overall assistance requirements as outlined in the DPPC appeal and to assist in filling the remaining gaps. In the interest of facilitating DPPC's coordination of humanitarian aid to the war-displaced from different sources and harmonising UN assistance, this summary indicates:   identified needs of the displaced based on an assumed six-month initial period of emergency programming;    assistance pledged by UN Agencies in Ethiopia, including existing, re-programmed and re-imbursable resources;   additional funding requested by UN Agencies.   Not included in this Summary is data for contingency needs, if the situation were to deteriorate. A contingency planning exercise, in conjunction with the DPPC, is planned for the near future. Rehabilitation needs, which can only be determined when the displaced are able to return to their homes, have been excluded from this appeal. FINDINGS OF THE UN INTER-AGENCY MISSIONS General The UN Country Team assessment endorsed the main elements of the DPPC appeal. Both missions felt that the registration and screening system set up by the local authorities was comprehensive and, therefore, concluded that numbers and requests for assistance in the DPPC appeal were reasonable. The UN Agencies have agreed to base their budget calculations on an assumed six-month initial period of emergency programming and on a total of 190,000 DP. The UN missions were impressed with the local emergency coordination mechanisms set-up in Tigray and Afar. They pointed out that these coordinating systems had facilitated the distribution of initial relief assistance provided to date. They fully agreed with the governmental strategy to meet the needs of the displaced population by depending upon and bolstering existing structures. There have been significant local contributions to the ""displaced and war-affected"" with about US$ 10 million having been collected as of end of June. At the moment, it is unclear what portion of these funds is actually earmarked for the displaced or how the funds will be used. Nevertheless, the feeling of the UN assessment team was that UN assistance should complement, not replace these very commendable local efforts. Recommendations on Relief Assistance A) Food and nutrition requirementsThe missions’ findings clearly pointed out that food assistance is justified as the displaced have already put a heavy burden on the meagre resources of the hosting communities. Discussions were also held with the local authorities and the DPPC at the federal level on the issue of possible duplication of beneficiaries from the drought relief programme and this new emergency programme for the displaced. The Government will look into the means to resolve this potential problem. The missions recommend that immediate food assistance be provided to the 168,000 DP in Tigray and to 2,013 DP in Afar Region. The food needs of the remaining DP in Afar region needs further assessment. B) Health assistance requirementsThe Government’s policy of relying on existing health structures has resulted in the re-orientation of health services with health centres currently taking increasing responsibility for health services, while the hospitals cater to urgent civilian cases only. So far, the Government has been able to cater to the most essential needs of the displaced, but supplies are running out and, in some cases, budgets have already been exhausted. The mission reports indicate that there is a need to strengthen existing health services through the provision of supplies and, eventually, health personnel at all levels. Regular health programmes are to be sustained, including vaccination and immunisation campaigns. C) Water and sanitation assistance requirementsThe UN assessment reveals that housing of the displaced within existing communities, while commendable, is placing great stress on what was already a situation of meagre water resources. In Afar Region, this situation is aggravated due to the closure of the Assab road, stopping the arrangement of providing water by truck from Assab to the communities in need. To avoid further displacement due to lack of potable water, the mission to Afar recommends to supply the communities with jerry cans, water bladders, water purification material, additional water tankers, fittings to repair old or construct new water resources, as well as to support financing of trucking water in Afar Region. D) Shelter and householdThe UN mission notes that most of the displaced may have lost part or all of their economic assets and are depending either on relief or on the host community. In Tigray, especially since the rainy season has started, additional shelter materials are needed, as many of the host households can not provide adequate rooms or shelter. The mission recommends cooking and feeding utensils, tents, blankets and reinforced plastic sheets to be supplied to the affected areas. RESPONSE TO DPPC APPEAL FOOD AND NUTRITION The DPPC appealed for food and nutrition assistance for 300,000 DP. This is a planning figure that includes people likely to be affected in case of escalation of the present conflict. The UN Country Team prefers to consider the scenario of possible conflict escalation in a separate contingency plan, while maintaining the flexibility to launch an immediate appeal in case of aggravation of the current situation in terms of food and nutrition. It should also be noted that if the displaced in Tigray are not able to return to their communities in the near future, they will miss the main agriculture season and food assistance will have to be provided until around November 1999. Resources Pledged by UN Agencies World Food Programme (WFP)In collaboration with the DPPC, WFP has agreed to the re-allocation of 5,000 MTs of WFP cereal provided under a previous emergency operation to assist in meeting the needs of the displaced population. The total value of the re-allocated commodities, inclusive of all associated transport costs, is US$ 1.6 million. At the time of writing this Appeal, the most urgent food needs are therefore being met through the re-allocation of drought relief resources, as well as various relatively small donations of supplementary food from non-UN sources. Additional Resources Required WFPWFP endorses the UN inter-agency missions’ assessment of food assistance based on an estimate of the currently displaced population and calls upon the international donors to channel an initial six-month-ration through WFP or other partners working in the field. If the situation in Tigray and Afar deteriorates or is prolonged indefinitely, WFP proposes a re-assessment of food assistance needs in affected areas and the possible launching of a new emergency operation (EMOP) that will appeal directly for funding and support to international donors. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)FAO does not normally provide emergency food and shelter assistance. However, FAO has been active in rehabilitation in Ethiopia for many years and when the displaced return home, FAO would consider rehabilitation assistance in the agriculture sector, if funding were available. An assessment of input requirements could be carried out at the earliest next year, since the current year's planting season will be over in August. HEALTH All three UN Agencies working in the health sector, UNICEF, WHO and UNFPA, have proposed an emergency programme under this sector. UNICEF will concentrate on Emergency Health, Safe Delivery and Vaccination, WHO on Emergency Health and UNFPA on Reproductive Health. UNICEF and UNFPA plan to provide delivery kits with complementary contents. UNICEF's kits are destined for the ""Traditional birth attendants"" and will be distributed at the lowest health delivery point level. UNFPA's kits are destined for health and referral centres. A Standard Emergency Health Kit, supplied by WHO and UNICEF, covers the essential drugs for 5,000 persons for six months. The same applies to the Safe Delivery and Reproductive Health Kits at the primary health level, whereas the Kits destined for health centres have an increased percentage of coverage due to its being a re-usable material. (15,000 persons for six months). Resources Pledged by UN Agencies United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)UNICEF will appeal to the international donor community for assistance valued at a total of US$ 1.5 million. In order to meet the most pressing emergency needs, UNICEF has already allocated US$ 500,000 from its Global Emergency Programme Fund. However, this is a revolving Fund and US$ 500,000 from this Appeal for US$ 1.5 million will be used to reimburse the Fund. The Agency’s emergency action plan will be implemented in two phases: the first phase will be funded with the US$ 500,000 available now from the Global Emergency Programme Fund, while the implementation of the second phase of US$ 1 million will depend on the resources generated by this Appeal. In the health sector, UNICEF appeals for a total of US$ 380,000, US$ 190,000 of which has been earmarked from the Global Emergency Fund of US$ 500,000. The funds are destined for vaccines, vitamin A capsules, safe delivery kits and Oral Re-hydration Solution (ORS). The ultimate plan is to cover 100 percent of the target population. The budget for the first phase is calculated to cover approximately 60 percent of the target population with the following breakdown:   Pledged from the Global Emergency Fund  (US$)    Measles and meningitis vaccines  120,000    Vitamin A  5,000    Delivery/TBA kits  55,000    ORS  10,000    Value First Phase  190,000    In consultation with the Government, UNICEF will also re-programme 50 Emergency Health Kits to the affected areas. These 50 Kits will cover the health needs of 250,000 persons for six months. Total Value: US$ 250,000 World Health Organization (WHO)WHO has delivered ten Standard Emergency Health Kits donated by the Italian Government with a total coverage of 50,000 persons for a period of six months. These kits have been handed over to the Ministry of Health for transport to the regions and, after mutual agreement upon use and areas to be covered, will be distributed to the selected health facilities. Included in the total budget is US$ 50,000 to cover transport, distribution and implementation costs. Total Value: US$ 150,000 Additional Resources Required UNICEFFor the second phase, UNICEF plans to allocate an additional amount of US$ 190,000 to reach the balance of the vaccination and Vitamin A campaign target population. WHO and WHO Pan-african Emergency Training Centre and Emergency Health Training Programme for Africa (PTC/EHTP)Depending on the gap between recommended needs and pledged quantities of health supply items, WHO will consider additional assistance in the health sector. After reviewing possible additional needs, and if a request is received from Government for capacity-building and training, WHO, in consultation with the WHO Pan-african Emergency Training Centre, could provide technical expertise in emergency health training. United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)UNFPA does not have funds for emergency programmes and, as the Ethiopian Government's general policy is not to use country programme funds for emergencies, UNFPA is appealing to international donors for US$ 134,000 to provide Emergency Reproductive Health Kits to the affected areas (including transport). These kits would complement the Emergency Health Kits being provided by WHO and UNICEF and would contribute, inter alia, to the reduction of maternal and neo-natal mortality, provide an adequate mix of contraceptives and help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. If funds are made available, UNFPA would provide contraceptive kits (condoms, oral and injectable contraceptives), Delivery Kits for health and referral centres, and kits for complications of abortions and post-rape cases. WATER AND SANITATION Resources Pledged By UN Agencies UNICEFUNICEF is the only UN Agency to propose an emergency programme in the area of water and sanitation. After consultations with DPPC, a budget of US$ 400,000 (US$ 130,000 for the first phase) for water and sanitation has been agreed upon. Under this programme, it is anticipated that the DP will have access to five litres of clean water a day. Assuming that some of the existing wells can be rehabilitated, UNICEF has allocated most of the budget to fittings, pipes and other construction material, including pumps (some of them motorised), for more important repair works. In addition, funds are allocated in phases one and two for the purchase of compact water treatment plants, bladders, as well as latrines. UNICEF will carry out further site assessment prior to deciding on a detailed activity plan. The following breakdown is therefore tentative and might be subject to changes.    Supplies and equipment in pledged from Global Emergency Fund    Budget Items  US$    Equipment and tools  94,000    Logistics, monitoring, evaluation  36,000    Total Value  130,000    Additional Resources Required UNICEFIn support of the second phase of Water and Sanitation intervention, UNICEF is seeking funding to cover the following interventions:    Supplies and Equipment    Budget Items  US$    Equipment and tools  197,000    Logistics, monitoring, evaluation  66,000    Training, community mobilisation  7,000    Total Value  270,000    SHELTER AND HOUSEHOLD ITEMS The UN Country Team has agreed to give priority to items that can not be purchased locally, i.e. plastic sheets rather than blankets. The basic calculation used in calculating plastic sheeting needs is ten square metres per family, i.e. at an estimate of 38,000 displaced families, 380,000 sq. metres or 1,900 rolls. Resources Pledged By UN Agencies UNICEFUS$ 40,000 from US$ 500,000 Global Emergency Fund has been allocated for the purchase of 120 rolls of plastic sheeting which were to be shipped in late July. UNHCRIn the framework of a joint UN effort to assist the civilian victims of the current conflict, UNHCR will make available 3,000 kerosene stoves with a total value, inclusive of all transport costs, of US$ 24,000. Additional Resources Required UNICEF A second phase programme is planned for US$ 70,000 for the supply of eight large tents (70 sq. metres each) and 54 family size tents, as well as 2,000 blankets. UNHCROther relief items in the area of shelter and / or household utensils are still being sought from outside. Failing this, up to US$ 15,000 may be made available, in consultation with DPPC, for local procurement of supplies, provided sufficient quantities are not supplied by other agencies. OCHAThe Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), formerly the Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), maintains a warehouse of emergency supplies in Pisa. On the recommendation of the UN Ethiopia Disaster Management Team and in response to an official appeal from the Government, OCHA can request the donor to allocate items on inventory to meet the emergency needs or, if stocks are not readily available from the Pisa warehouse, OCHA can approach other donors for funds. The initial appeal to OCHA will be for 375 rolls of plastic sheeting, valued at approximately US$ 175,000 including transport, enough for 7,500 families at ten sq. meters per family. UNDP’s Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia (EUE) will implement the programme. UNDPThe Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia (EUE) seeks funds in the amount of US$ 175,000 to purchase an additional 350 to 400 rolls of plastic sheeting either directly, or by reimbursing UNHCR for Plastic Sheeting borrowed from UNHCR. If OCHA is able to provide 350 rolls of plastic sheeting, and additional 350 to 400 rolls can be funded from other sources the total UN supply, including the donation from UNICEF, would cover about 46 percent of the shelter needs, at ten sq. meter per family. As shelter materials are one of the most urgent needs, donors are encouraged to donate additional plastic sheeting through the DPPC, the UN, or any of the other operational agencies. OTHER ASSISTANCE Education UNICEFAlthough education was not part of the DPPC appeal, UNICEF seeks funding for a total of US$ 325,000 to support educational programmes for the displaced. Based on the rate of 22 percent of children in the age group of 7-14 years, and a gross enrolment ratio of 50 percent in Tigray and 10 percent in Afar, UNICEF estimates a school-going population among the displaced to be 19,800 children in Tigray and 440 in Afar. Out of the US$ 500,000 Global Emergency Fund, US$ 125,000 has been ear-marked for the first phase intervention which would reach 70 percent of the displaced school-going children. The funds will be used in the following sectors:  Orientation of educational administrators on the planning, implementation and monitoring of Emergency Education Interventions.   Collection of data/information required for planning and designing emergency education interventions.   Provision of educational materials.   Training of in-service teachers in the planning, design and implementation of emergency interventions for displaced children and in the organisation of counselling services.   Advocacy and social mobilisation campaigns using interpersonal communication channels and radio broadcast.  UNESCOUNESCO is considering a contribution to the war-affected children from its Programme for Emergency Education and Rehabilitation. Areas of assistance are still to be determined. UNFPAThe UNFPA Country Support Team (UNFPA/CST) offers its technical expertise in the field of planning, design and implementation of emergency education interventions to support other agencies’ educational programmes. Special Protection Needs of Displaced Children and Women UNICEFUNICEF's budget for special protection needs foresees an emergency programme valued at a total of US$ 70,000. Key actions of the programme are: a) training of local counsellors to provide counselling services to street children and their parents/guardians; b) training of religious leaders, women's groups and social workers to carry out psycho-social trauma counselling and crisis management; c) sensitising community leaders and local authorities to the basic rights of children and women; The first phase of this programme will use US$ 15,000 from the Global Emergency Fund for assessment, analysis and activity planning. Reintegration and Rehabilitation International Organization for Migration (IOM)Subject to an agreement with the Government, IOM would consider requesting funds for a survey to assess the location and number of Ethiopians returning from Eritrea, as well as to make a breakdown in categories (traders, farmers, skilled/unskilled labour, etc.). This categorisation is an essential basis for any rehabilitation and reintegration programme. Logistic Support to UN Agencies UNDPUNDP has made available US$ 40.000 to cover international and local transport costs for supplies donated by other agencies for which there are no transport funds. UNICEFUNICEF is seeking funding for transportation of supplies in the amount of US$ 45,000. Coordination Support to UN Agencies UNDP Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia (EUE)UNDP has allocated funds to engage an international or local temporary Information Officer with the EUE for three months. (Total amount: US$ 12,000) The Information Officer will, in collaboration with other EUE staff, work on the production of reports, briefing materials, appeals and other facets of coordination to assist the Resident Coordinator and the UN Country Team. Capacity-Building, - Contingency Planning in Case of Escalation of the Conflict UNDPUNDP has allocated funds for international and / or local consultants and incidental costs for development of contingency plans. (Total amount: US$ 13,000). IOMIn order to strengthen local capacities, IOM's Emergency Response Unit based in Geneva, if required, can offer training in emergency preparedness, including initiating and maintaining an early warning system, cross border management, legislation and administration. Monitoring, Evaluation and Continuing AssessmentAs the situation along the border remains fluid, continuing assessment and reporting will be critical, as well as regular monitoring and evaluation of the activities implemented through the various components outlined in this Summary. Although most agencies will attempt to use existing staff and the UN Country Team will continue to work as a team, some additional funding will be needed to cover the special monitoring needs of this emergency programme. UNICEFUNICEF's emergency plan includes quarterly programme monitoring and evaluation visits to the project sites, according to guidelines elaborated in collaboration with the Government of Ethiopia. The Agency seeks funding for a global monitoring and evaluation allocation in the amount of US$ 20,000. UNDP-EUEOne of the primary responsibilities of the Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia (EUE) is to support the Resident Coordination system through assisting in the coordination of the UN Country Teams responses to emergencies, facilitating information exchange and monitoring, assessments and evaluations. The EUE does not have a regular budget and must rely on ad hoc contributions from the donor community to cover its yearly operating costs. Included in the 1998 budget but not funded was US$70,000 for the replacement of two field vehicles. Field monitoring is an on-going EUE activity and these vehicles would be used by EUE field officers for the monitoring of UN assistance to the displaced, field visits to the drought-affected areas and for other emergency situations that are likely to arise in the near future. EUE therefore, reiterates its request for funding of US$ 70,000 to replace two field vehicles. This document indicates the UN Country Teams planned interventions in support of the DPPC appeal and how these inputs are harmonised within the UN system and complement the work of the various emergency committees. The intention is to bring to the attention of the international community additional requirements in order that the most urgent needs of the displaced people in Tigray and Afar are met in a timely fashion. Interested donors are urged to contact the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator, on behalf of the Country Team or representatives of the concerned specialised UN Agencies in Ethiopia, for more detailed information on programmes for the displaced. Also, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), has been fully informed of the UN Country Teams plans and can be contacted for additional information. ANNEX I.

178,39303,[12033],Mine Action,WFP food convoy hits landmine in Northwest Rwanda,"The World Food Programme announced that a five-truck convoy which was delivering food aid to 9,000 internally displaced people in Rwanda's Ruhengeri prefecture hit a landmine yesterday morning, killing a passenger and wounding the driver. The passenger was employee of Ruhengeri commune. No other casualties were reported. ""We do not know who is responsible for this very grave incident, but we request the authorities to immediately investigate,"" said Gerard van Dijk, WFP Representative to Rwanda. WFP will meet with government officials on necessary security arrangements for future convoys. The 40 ton convoy was travelling on a subsidiary dirt road to Gatonde commune when a landmine detonated under one of the trucks. This is the first incident in Rwanda involving a landmine since 1994. In keeping with standard security measures, the convoy was escorted by the Rwandan army, who had assigned 25 soldiers and three vehicles. The first vehicle in the convoy -- a pick-up truck with a military contingent -- did not detonate the landmine. The landmine was instead activated by the first food truck which belonged to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), leased to WFP. Four of the five trucks returned last night to Kigali intact. WFP will arrange today for the damaged truck and food to be recovered. WFP is providing food to 250,000 people in Northwest Rwanda who have been internally displaced by heavy insecurity in the region. For the first half of the year, relief agencies had only partial and periodic access to the area, limiting the amount of humanitarian assistance that could be sent in. In June, WFP was able to resume food aid deliveries to Gisenyi prefecture. Deliveries to Ruhengeri followed in mid-July.
